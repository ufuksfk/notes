I am actively using Snipd and also Matter for that use case. As sidenote, I am so podcast addict that I am listening to podcast with 2 hours per day frequency for more than 3 years.

So I really loved omnivore app and the idea behind it. I am now trying to understand how can I help you to make it real. I strongly believe it might be very good way to seperate free and paid users.

For the copyright thing, there is also no user experience of listening to the audiobook while you can also follow the text. Another thing is [matter](https://getmatter.com/), [snipd](https://www.snipd.com/), readwise all have "tap to headphones to highlight" option, I failed to find that convenience in any audiobook app.

So, I am not a lawyer, but I believe transcribing a podcast versus transcribing a book is totally different problems. For the podcast part, there is also something called [podcast 2.0](https://podcasting2.org/apps). Last time I checked, they have a tag for transcript.

A couple of links for podcast 2.0:

[https://podcastindex.org/](https://podcastindex.org/)

[https://podcastindex.org/podcast/920666](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/920666) That podcast has transcripts as srt for example.

Actually, having a transcript for a podcast is also useful for podcast publishers. [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-language-of-the-universe/) is doing that for very long time. But I still need to use snipd or matter to get transcription and highlight important parts while listening. So, normally solutions seems to have new RSS format for podcast so that creators can add their transcripts with timetag.
