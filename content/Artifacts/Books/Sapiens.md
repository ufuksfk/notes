  From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s
  creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in
  which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of
  what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six
  different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo
  sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books
  about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological
  approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original
  book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern
  cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global
  ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and
  science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with
  contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of
  larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last
  few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have
  governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to
  design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading
  us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25
  illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark
  debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James
  Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.
