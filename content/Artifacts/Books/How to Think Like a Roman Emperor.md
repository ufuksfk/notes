  _The life-changing principles of Stoicism taught through the story of its most
  famous proponent._  
    
  Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius was the final famous Stoic philosopher of the
  ancient world. _The Meditations_, his personal journal, survives to this day
  as one of the most loved self-help and spiritual classics of all time. In _How
  to Think Like a Roman Emperor_, cognitive psychotherapist Donald Robertson
  weaves the life and philosophy of Marcus Aurelius together seamlessly to
  provide a compelling modern-day guide to the Stoic wisdom followed by
  countless individuals throughout the centuries as a path to achieving greater
  fulfillment and emotional resilience.  
    
  _How to Think Like a Roman Emperor_ takes readers on a transformative journey
  along with Marcus, following his progress from a young noble at the court of
  Hadrian—taken under the wing of some of the finest philosophers of his
  day—through to his reign as emperor of Rome at the height of its power.
  Robertson shows how Marcus used philosophical doctrines and therapeutic
  practices to build emotional resilience and endure tremendous adversity, and
  guides readers through applying the same methods to their own lives.  
    
  Combining remarkable stories from Marcus’s life with insights from modern
  psychology and the enduring wisdom of his philosophy, _How to Think Like a
  Roman Emperor_ puts a human face on Stoicism and offers a timeless and
  essential guide to handling the ethical and psychological challenges we face
  today.
