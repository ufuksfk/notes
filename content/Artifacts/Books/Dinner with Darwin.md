  What do eggs, flour, and milk have in common? They form the basis of waffles,
  of course, but these staples of breakfast bounty also share an evolutionary
  eggs, seeds (from which we derive flour by grinding), and milk have each
  evolved to nourish offspring. Indeed, ponder the genesis of your breakfast,
  lunch, or dinner, and you’ll soon realize that everything we eat and drink has
  an evolutionary history. In Dinner with Darwin , join Jonathan Silvertown for
  a multicourse meal of evolutionary gastronomy, a tantalizing tour of human
  taste that helps us to understand the origins of our diets and the foods that
  have been central to them for millennia—from spices to spirits.  
    
  A delectable concoction of coevolution and cookery, gut microbiomes and
  microherbs, and both the chicken and its egg, Dinner with Darwin reveals that
  our shopping lists, recipe cards, and restaurant menus don’t just contain the
  ingredients for culinary delight. They also tell a fascinating story about
  natural selection and its influence on our plates—and palates. Digging deeper,
  Silvertown’s repast includes entrées into GMOs and hybrids, and looks at the
  science of our sensory interactions with foods and cooking—the sights, aromas,
  and tastes we experience in our kitchens and dining rooms. As is the wont of
  any true chef, Silvertown packs his menu with eclectic components, dishing on
  everything from Charles Darwin’s intestinal maladies to taste bud anatomy and
  turducken.  
    
  Our evolutionary relationship with food and drink stretches from the days of
  cooking cave dwellers to contemporary crêperies and beyond, and Dinner with
  Darwin serves up scintillating insight into the entire, awesome span. This
  feast of soup, science, and human society is one to savor. With a wit as dry
  as a fine pinot noir and a cache of evolutionary knowledge as vast as the most
  discerning connoisseur’s wine cellar, Silvertown whets our appetites—and
  leaves us hungry for more.
