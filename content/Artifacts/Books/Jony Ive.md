description: "“Different and new is relatively\_easy. Doing something that’s\_genuinely better is very hard.” —Jony Ive  \nIn 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as CEO with the unenviable task of turning around the company he had founded. One night, Jobs discovered a scruffy British designer toiling away at Apple’s corporate headquarters, surrounded by hundreds of sketches and prototypes. It was then that Jobs realized he had found a talent who could reverse the company’s long decline.  \nThat young designer was Jony Ive.\_  \n  \nJony Ive’s collaboration with Jobs would produce\_some of the world’s most iconic technology products,\_including the iMac, iPod, iPad, and iPhone. The designs have not only made Apple a hugely valuable\_company, they’ve overturned entire industries, built\_a loyal fan base, and created a globally powerful\_brand. Along the way, Jony Ive has become the\_world’s leading technology innovator, won countless design awards, earned a place on the 2013 Time \_100 list, and was even knighted for his “services to\_design and enterprise.”  \nYet despite his triumphs, little is known about the shy and soft-spoken whiz whom Jobs referred to\_as his “spiritual partner” at Apple. Jony Ive reveals\_the true story of Apple’s real innovator-in-chief.  \nLeander Kahney, the bestselling author of Inside\_Steve’s Brain , offers a detailed portrait of a creative genius. He shows us how Jony Ive went from an\_English art school student with dyslexia to the man\_whose immense insights have altered the pattern\_of our lives. From his early interest in industrial\_design, fostered by his designer father, through his education at Newcastle Polytechnic and meteoric rise at Apple, we discover the principles and practices that he developed to become the designer of his generation.  \nBased on interviews with Jony Ive’s former colleagues and Kahney’s own familiarity with the world of Apple, this book gives insight into how Jony Ive (now senior vice president of design) has redefined the ways in which we work, entertain, and communicate with one another."
