  I listened to the audiobook and it is basically a very good book that everyone
  should read. I am planning to read hard copy after a couple of years.

  Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real
  father and the father of his best friend, his "rich dad" — and the ways in
  which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book
  explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains
  the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.
