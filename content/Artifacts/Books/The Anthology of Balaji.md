  How do you thrive in an unknown future?  
    
  When you can’t see past the world we have now, look to visionaries like Balaji
  Srinivasan. His ideas show us how to build a healthier, brighter, and more
  technologically-advanced humanity.  
    
  In The Anthology of A Guide to Technology, Truth, and Building the Future,
  **Eric Jorgenson** curates a collection of Balaji’s wisdom from his entire
  career. In “Technology” you will see how technology shapes our world today and
  the ways it could shape our future. In “Truth” you learn how to think for
  yourself through the constant clamor of information and media. Finally, in
  “Building the Future,” you will learn how to wield Technology and Truth to
  change your life, change your community, and—maybe—change the future of our
  species.  
    
  This guide will help you pick the next great investment, start a
  billion-dollar company, or even a new country. The Anthology of Balaji helps
  you visualize and build your brightest future.
