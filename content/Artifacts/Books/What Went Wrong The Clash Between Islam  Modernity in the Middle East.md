description: >-
  For many centuries, the world of Islam was in the forefront of human
  achievement--the foremost military and economic power in the world, the leader
  in the arts and sciences of civilization. Christian Europe, a remote land
  beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism
  and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then
  everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory,
  first in the battlefield and the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of
  public and even private life.  
    
  In this intriguing volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of
  the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed--how they
  had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the
  West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows
  how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry
  and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy,
  education and culture. Lewis highlights the striking differences between the
  Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the 18th to the 20th centuries
  through thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and
  Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil
  society, the clock and the calendar.  
    
  Hailed in The New York Times Book Review as "the doyen of Middle Eastern
  studies," Bernard Lewis is one of the West's foremost authorities on Islamic
  history and culture. In this striking volume, he offers an incisive look at
  the historical relationship between the Middle East and Europe.
