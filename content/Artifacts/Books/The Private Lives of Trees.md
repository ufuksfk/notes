  The Private Lives of Trees tells the story of a single night: a young
  professor of literature named Julián is reading to his step-daughter Daniela
  and nervously waiting for his wife Verónica to return from her art class. Each
  night, Julián has been improvising a story about trees to tell Daniela before
  she goes to sleep, and each Sunday he works on a novel about a man tending to
  his bonsai, but something about this night is different. As Julián becomes
  increasing concerned that Verónica won’t return, he reflects on their life
  together in minute detail, and imagines what Daniela—at twenty, at
  twenty-five, at thirty years old, without a mother—will think of his novel.
  Perhaps even more daring and dizzying than Zambra’s magical Bonsai, The
  Private Lives of Trees demands to be read in a single sitting, and it casts a
  spell that will bring you back to it again and again.
