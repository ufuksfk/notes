description: >-
  If the conscious mind—the part you consider you—accounts for only a tiny
  fraction of the brain’s function, what is all the rest doing? This is the
  question that David Eagleman—renowned neuroscientist and acclaimed author of
  Sum—answers in a book as accessible and entertaining as it is deeply informed
  by startling, up-to-the-minute research.
