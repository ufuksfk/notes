  **Bill Gates shares what he's learned in more than a decade of studying
  climate change and investing in innovations to address the problems, and sets
  out a vision for how the world can build the tools it needs to get to zero
  greenhouse gas emissions.**  
    
  Bill Gates explains why he cares so deeply about climate change and what makes
  him optimistic that the world can prevent the worst impacts of the climate
  crisis. Gates says, "we can work on a local, national, and global level to
  build the technologies, businesses, and industries to avoid the worst impacts
  of climate change." His interest in climate change is a natural outgrowth of
  the efforts by his foundation to reduce poverty and disease. Climate change,
  according to Gates, will have the biggest impact on the people who have done
  the least to cause it. As a technologist, he has seen first-hand how
  innovation can change the world. By investing in research, inventing new
  technologies, and by deploying them quickly at large scale, Gates believes
  climate change can be addressed in meaningful ways. According to Gates, "to
  prevent the worst effects of climate change, we have to get to net-zero
  emissions of greenhouse gases. This problem is urgent, and the debate is
  complex, but I believe we can come together to invent new carbon-zero
  technologies, deploy the ones we have, and ultimately avoid a climate
  catastrophe."
