  What are the most important days of your life?  
    
  Meet Brás de Oliva Domingos. The miracle child of a world-famous Brazilian
  writer, Brás spends his days penning other people's obituaries and his nights
  dreaming of becoming a successful author himself—writing the end of other
  people's stories, while his own has barely begun.  
    
  But on the day that life begins, would he even notice? Does it start at 21
  when he meets the girl of his dreams? Or at 11, when he has his first kiss? Is
  it later in his life when his first son is born? Or earlier when he might have
  found his voice as a writer?  
    
  Each day in Brás's life is like a page from a book. Each one reveals the
  people and things who have made him who he is: his mother and father, his
  child and his best friend, his first love and the love of his life. And like
  all great stories, each day has a twist he'll never see coming...  
    
  In _Daytripper_, the Eisner Award-winning twin brothers Fábio Moon and Gabriel
  Bá tell a magical, mysterious and moving story about life itself—a hauntingly
  lyrical journey that uses the quiet moments to ask the big questions.
