review: >-
  I actually listened to the audiobook of it and it was a summary of the book.
  It took 4 hours to listen to it all.  

  It has stunning social experiments and results with clear explanations about
  human behavior.  

  To summarize in one sentence, we are all liars in different levels and
  aspects.

  **_The New York Times_ bestselling author of _Predictably Irrational_ and _The
  Upside of Irrationality_ returns with thought-provoking work to challenge our
  preconceptions about dishonesty and urge us to take an honest look at
  ourselves.**  
    
  Does the chance of getting caught affect how likely we are to cheat? How do
  companies pave the way for dishonesty? Does collaboration make us more honest
  or less so? Does religion improve our honesty? Most of us think of ourselves
  as honest, but, in fact, we all cheat. From Washington to Wall Street, the
  classroom to the workplace, unethical behavior is everywhere. None of us is
  immune, whether it's the white lie to head off trouble or padding our expense
  reports.  
    
  In _The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty_, award-winning, bestselling author
  Dan Ariely turns his unique insight and innovative research to the question of
  dishonesty. Generally, we assume that cheating, like most other decisions, is
  based on a rational cost-benefit analysis. But Ariely argues, and then
  demonstrates, that it's actually the irrational forces that we don't take into
  account that often determine whether we behave ethically or not. For every
  Enron or political bribe, there are countless puffed résumés, hidden
  commissions, and knockoff purses.  
    
  In _The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty_, Ariely shows why some things are
  easier to lie about; how getting caught matters less than we think; and how
  business practices pave the way for unethical behavior, both intentionally and
  unintentionally. Ariely explores how unethical behavior works in the personal,
  professional, and political worlds, and how it affects all of us, even as we
  think of ourselves as having high moral standards. But all is not lost. Ariely
  also identifies what keeps us honest, pointing the way for achieving higher
  ethics in our everyday lives. With compelling personal and academic
  findings,  
    
  _The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty_ will change the way we see ourselves,
  our actions, and others
