### [0:00 Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAMrvzcBxU&type=snipo&t=0s)

the reason is not ADHD or procastination. You are trying system for neurotypical people. You set to fail even before you start.

### [3:09 Understanding WHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAMrvzcBxU&type=snipo&t=189s)

There are 5 steps ðŸ™‚

Why traditional method fails?

We either fail or win because we have dopamine dysregulation.

If you miss a day, you will feel fucked up!

We are chasing a new shiny thing!

### [5:22 Step 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAMrvzcBxU&type=snipo&t=322s)

We are best at sprint in short burst!

Usain bolt is not for endurance running!

One big goal is too big, need smaller goals like small sprints!

Just decide first sprint for a couple of weeks. And give a break! And decide second one later!

Explore sth new, recharge and decide later.

### [8:24 Step 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAMrvzcBxU&type=snipo&t=504s)

You need to start with the easiest task first! It fills your dopamine

### [10:04 Step 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAMrvzcBxU&type=snipo&t=604s)

Reward yourself! It can be as small as going to fancy restaurant or going for a small vacation!

### [11:20 Step 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAMrvzcBxU&type=snipo&t=680s)

You should connect those to your big story!

If your goal is not exciting, you should make it exciting.

Turning your goals into quests

Anchroing a feeling of the outcome

### [12:50 Step 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAMrvzcBxU&type=snipo&t=770s)

Probabilities of Completing a goal

- Having an idea or goal 10%
- Consciously deciding that you will do it 25%
- Deciding when you will do it 40%
- Planning how to do it 50%
- Committing to someone that you will do it 65%
- Having a spesific accountability appointment with someone youâ€™ve committed to 95%

Deadline from teacher or bosses are always better than saying to your friend.
