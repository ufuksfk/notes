# Note
 * Alfred Adler's individual psychology theory is based on the will to power, where individuals strive to overcome feelings of inferiority and become their true selves.

* Birth order and family dynamics play a significant role in shaping personality traits and behaviors, with each child developing a "ticket to admission" within the family.

* Childhood experiences are important in Adlerian therapy, as it focuses on how past events are currently interpreted and manifested in behaviors, aiming to uncover and address underlying issues for personal growth and self-actualization.

* Listeners are encouraged to provide feedback and leave reviews on platforms like Apple to share their thoughts on the content and suggest improvements.

* The hosts engage in light-hearted banter and humor, creating a relaxed and enjoyable listening experience for the audience.


## Highlights
* [[2025-01-04]] 21:37  That would have been a great get. Yeah, let's talk, let's talk about this guy's early life. This is, I mean, obviously interesting that he was born in Vienna in the late 1800s, which, which almost guarantees that you're going to be a world renowned psychologist because I mean, he's in Vienna with Frankel and Freud at the same exact time. And Carl Jung's hanging around there too. I mean, crazy, just crap.

* [[2025-01-04]] 21:36  I like his idea is that we're all driven to overcome these feelings. And that is when we, you know, when you get into what Carl Rogers would call self actualization. But all these, like, you're growing up and you're feeling inferior, but that is essentially what has to happen as a child. And to become yourself, you have to overcome these inferiority complexes. That's what he's kind of talking about.
