## Highlights
* [[2024-03-23]] 09:27  I'm a full stack developer at open climate Fix OCF that's the shortening of open Climate Fix is a non profit product lab and we're developing renewable energy forecasts to decarbonize the electricity grid.

* [[2024-03-23]] 12:34  The grammar of a coding language and then beginning to understand larger data structures is like beginning to understand paragraphs that lead to arguments that you can build something with your code structure in the same way that you do linguistically with language.

* [[2024-03-23]] 12:39  I don't speak JavaScript or Python, but I can read it. Okay. Like Latin, I suppose. All right. Okay, so that's some of the background that you had, and you've been working with open climate fix for the last few months or so.

* [[2024-03-23]] 15:40  No, we're around twelve people, so less than ten people. Yeah. Wow. That's pretty impressive for me, getting to.

* [[2024-03-23]] 16:18  So, off the back of this particular conversation, there's a book called Real Decarbonization by Tish Schuler, and it talks about how the energy transition is going to involve oil companies, shell, BP, these large entities. And I feel like if people are involved in the energy transition, it's a really useful book to read, even though you might not agree with everything that she's saying and everything that she's talking about.

* [[2024-03-23]] 16:18  It came from an article in the MIT Technology review called Recapture in the whimsy of the early Internet, and it's a movement called the HTML energy movement. I don't know if you've talked about it before on the. Never heard of this.

* [[2024-03-23]] 16:22  Yeah, so I have my LinkedIn is Rachel Libre Tipton, GitHub is also rachel libre Tipton. And then I have a substac that I write, which is the tech generalist.
