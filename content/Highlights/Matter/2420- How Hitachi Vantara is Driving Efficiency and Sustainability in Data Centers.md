## Highlights
* [[2024-11-14]] 23:45  Her name is Lynne Collier. She's the Global Solutions Manager for Digital Infrastructure at Hitachi Vantara. And today, Lyn will enlighten us about Hitachi's transformative work with a South African IT company called Jijima. We'll explore Hitachi's solutions and how they've greatly enhanced sustainability and efficiency in data centers without compromising performance, reliability, or disaster recovery, and much more

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:46  Kojima is one of those really interesting customers that we've had the chance to work with. They're one of South Africa's leading ICT companies and they're providing cloud infrastructure, IT and outsourcing services both for enterprise clients and small to medium businesses. It's a proudly 100% black owned company with level one BBBE status and they've got a state of the Art Tier 3 data center that hosts a lot of business critical systems for many of their biggest clients

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:46  And Hitachi was really confident that we could help them with their capabilities to address those requirements. And partly that was underpinned not only by our confidence in our own solutions, but for nine consecutive years, Neil Hitachi's VSP storage platform has earned the highest rating for raas. So reliability, availability and serviceability in the Gartner Storage critical capability reports

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:46  Hitachi VSP systems at their production data center and we also put in additional arrays for disaster recovery, and that helps significantly consolidate the physical infrastructure and free up some additional racks of space at the disaster recovery site. So the result is the new deployment provides a much smaller footprint, a considerable reduction in power consumption, and that in turn reduces the CO2 emissions and helps them not only address their sustainability goals, but also to save on ever increasing energy cost

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:48  And also of course Combined with the rise of ESG scores. And a lot of businesses are starting to look at who they partner with based on these scores as well. And as a result, greentech is entering the mainstream now. So with data centers consuming significant amounts of electricity, I've got to ask, how is Hitachi Ventura enhancing data storage systems to improve both sustainability and efficiency?

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:49  well over 50% of the conversations and RFPs that we work on with customers and our partners, you know, sustainability is front and center for many of them.

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:49  We've got a whole range of innovative diagnostics and data driven automation, but at the core, we design, develop and deliver data storage systems that consume up to less, 30 to 40% less energy at every release. And given that the VSP is also manufactured in Japan, that's known to produce pretty much 38% less CO2 than other major manufacturing locations.

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:13  The storage virtualization operating system, or SFOS as we call it, can actually help reduce CO2 emissions with innovations such as enhanced data reduction technology. And that lets the customers store more data on their purchase capacity.

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:47  Kojima's case, when I was doing a bit of research, one of the standout stats for me was that they saw a 66% reduction in power, cooling and space requirements after deploying Hitachi VSP systems. So can you elaborate on some of the tech behind these scenes, these systems?

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:47  I think it's important to note that Hitachi Vantara is the only carbon footprint certified storage platform available with their Energy Star certification, which your listeners can look at if they pop onto our website. But back to Kojima. During the project they successfully installed with us two Hitachi VSP5000 series arrays at the production center and then two VSP G700 arrays for their disaster recovery. These were all flash storage systems which replaced the bulkier spinning disk arrays so that significantly consolidated the physical infrastructure and the result of that was it reduced from nine racks down to three in production and also freed up an additional two racks in the discovery site.

* [[2024-11-14]] 23:31  And also in doing so, what were the main benefits of such consolidation? Beyond the obvious space saving elements there.
