## Highlights
* [[2024-05-05]] 09:49  Today we are speaking with Anton Tashenko, who is better known as Doctor EMC and the founder of PCB. For emc.com dot.

* [[2024-05-05]] 11:18  There's like, I stole this line from somewhere, but is pretty much a 50% failure rate on the EMC testing for the first time.

* [[2024-05-07]] 12:29  Typically you do want to make them smaller. So for like millimeter wave at 28, structure would be of about this size.

* [[2024-05-07]] 13:16  And so this would be compatible with, with analog digital hybrid beam forming all the standard beamforming methods. Yeah, because essentially the mirror is neutral.
