## Highlights
* [[2024-12-23]] 12:31  but typically it's employed in subsea settings and where you want to be underground. And it's really good at doing that. Ac, it's good for moving voltages. You can transform, you can go from distribution up to transmission. Our motors work nicely off it, and it's very familiar.

* [[2024-12-23]] 12:31  So the like overhead, the reason why the wires are so far apart and the bigger, the higher the voltage, the bigger the pylons. And the reason there is because they're air insulated, so you're not using insulation so you can run more current through them. And it's the cheapest way of moving power from A to B. Like you cannot compete with it.

* [[2024-12-23]] 12:31  It is just a really economic way of moving power from A to B. The issue is, in the developed world, a lot of people don't like looking at them. If they're there, they'll accept them, but if they're coming, they'll worry about them and there'll be a lot of confusion, all sorts of shenanigans going on. Concerns genuine, some people stirring up social media.
