## Highlights
* [[2024-06-13]] 22:17  So we've had previous generations where you might need to have a bit of a wait before piece of software can start running, before you can really use it. And this is like one of the key things that WASm has made available and that allows for, like you said, time. It basically means that there's less wasted time, but it also provide, opens the door for newer, more efficient platforms like this

* [[2024-06-13]] 22:18  Do you know what? I had a conversation from people outside of the big three, the big cloud providers. So in Texas, there's a company called build AI. They've been doing some work to basically they'll provide you computing, but at certain peak times, you don't have access to it. And as a result, they're able to have much lower costs for this stuff.

* [[2024-06-13]] 22:18  So I'll share a link to that. And there's a company called Saluna also in Texas as well. And what they do is they speak to generators, people who run, like, clean energy. And they'll basically say, we will give you a floor price under which you will never give you something like that. And using that, they are able to provide these kind of services.

* [[2024-06-02]] 19:10  So p u e stands for power usage effectiveness or. Yeah, effectiveness. Yeah. I always mix up the e words, power usage effectiveness, and I think in the sort of early days of green software, this was the number people spend a lot of time focusing on.

* [[2024-06-13]] 22:21  So, Scaleway, I think it's kind of related to stuff we talked about earlier. I was on this podcast with Scaleway where I learned a lot of stuff about what they were up to. There's some interesting things that they're doing totally away from Pue and we reporting. So in Europe, there's a group called the SDIA, which is an acronym, I can never remember what it sounds to say. Sustainable digital Infrastructure alliance.

* [[2024-06-02]] 20:53  That's a, that's actually, that's a big improvement in life, but it's not a guaranteed lock in everything that you make more efficient doesn't always result in overall there being more usage.

* [[2024-06-13]] 22:21  If people were curious about these terms that we've been using, like operational efficiency, coding efficiency, things like that, this is what's outlined in the book that you three have been working on, is that correct? It is indeed, yes. Building green software, the new book from O'Reilly. And there was one question I was going to ask because we spoke about this a few months ago. So this is currently available right now, and you can get it via O'Reilly.
