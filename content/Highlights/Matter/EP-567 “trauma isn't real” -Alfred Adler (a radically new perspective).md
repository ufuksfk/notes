Relates to [[Alfred Adler]]
# Note
 Trauma is not real according to Alfred Adler's Adlerian psychology, which challenges the belief that past experiences determine present outcomes.
By changing the meaning we give to past experiences, we can release the power they hold over us and create new opportunities for growth and transformation.
Revision technique, inspired by Neville Goddard, allows us to reframe past memories and change our present reality by altering the stories we tell ourselves.
Understanding that every moment is an opportunity for change and growth can help us break free from limiting patterns and open up to new possibilities in life.


## Highlights
* [[2025-01-02]] 15:26  And this simple philosophy that comes from one of the grandfathers of psychology, that of Alfred Adler, who founded something called Aldarian psychology. He is considered one of the grandfathers of psychoanalytics, including that of Carl Jung.

* [[2025-01-02]] 15:26  Now, one of the most powerful quotes and the most powerful things Albert Alfred Adler said was this. Are you ready? He said, no experience is a cause of success or failure.

* [[2025-01-02]] 17:10  The trauma that we have is a sensation inside of the body. It is something that you felt. However, the interpretation of that sensation that we label as trauma is what ends up keeping us in a form of box of also someone that is, in a way, I know myself. For years, I identified as someone that was a victim of my childhood. And even just recently, I realized, you know how I've been telling the story on YouTube for a long time, like from 7 to 15, I had no freedom in my life. I wasn't allowed to have friends.

* [[2025-01-02]] 17:10  Aldarian psychology is becoming aware of what is called your lifestyle. Now, lifestyle, you think of like, oh, I'm a surfer. My lifestyle. That's what you mean. Like, manifest it with your lifestyle. Lifestyle has to do with your beliefs about life. What is your style about life? What is your belief about life?

* [[2025-01-02]] 17:09  They're called Blublockers. Basically, Blublockers are two or three hours before bed. You wear these like orange tinted glasses that block out that of the blue light that is sending a message to your brain that it's still daylight.

* [[2025-01-04]] 23:26  I have been using this for about eight months now, literally every single night before I go to bed. And. And it's about a half an hour to 45 minutes before bed, I heat up some water and I mix this powder called Organifi Gold. Now it's called Organifi Gold. The flavor I use is chocolate.

* [[2025-01-02]] 17:14  Why is it that two kids that go and are raised in a certain way, one becomes maybe an empath and one becomes a narcissist. An empath, someone that can feel other people's energy that's tuning to others to feel safe and is sometimes even people pleasing. And then the narcissist who demands and has this personality like false sense of self that kind of demands everyone else is the way they are and they're manipulating to get their needs met subconsciously. The empath, many times is also, in a different covert way, is also doing the same thing to manipulate to get their needs met. Safety. However, why is it that one kid may turn out empath, one kid may turn out narcissist.

* [[2025-01-02]] 17:09  And because of that, they may also have different trajectories in their life. They may also experience a different level of forgiveness, a different level of healing because of it. So one thing you wanna become aware of is that the trauma that you have that you may give a lot of meaning to, and it may really justify why things happened when you were a kid.

* [[2025-01-02]] 17:15  And basically what he shared is that a couple years ago he got into an argument with his dad, and he lived in an apartment complex, and he ran out of the room, and then he ran down the stairs away from his dad. And when he did that, his dad started chasing him. And he may have instigated his dad a little bit. And his dad started chasing him. Well, his dad tripped down the stairs and died. And this guy, you could tell, felt extremely guilty. He literally thought he killed his dad. The trauma of that experience was written all over his face. Now, if you look at that, what the practitioner did is they took him and said, look, there's what happened. And then the story that we tell ourselves about what happened, and it's like, what happened. At the fundamental core, what happened was he left the house, the dad ran down the stairs, the dad tripped and died. That's what happened. The story about what happened was, I did this to my dad. Things were unresolved. I'm a horrible kid. I can't believe I. It was all this other baggage. Now, the healing comes when you realize that the meaning you're giving to the situation is the interpretation that is causing the emotions inside of you.

* [[2025-01-02]] 16:36  When we look at our past, the neurons in our brain, when we are in a confident state and we remember other times in our past when we were confident, we literally have more access to those memories because of the way our state is now.

* [[2025-01-02]] 17:13  So in an interesting way, one of the most powerful things I've learned to do is to remember certain things in my past. But literally know that I can overlay a new texture to it, a new interpretation of it, and as I remember it and give it a new texture, give it a new flavor, it literally changes. After so many repetitions, you begin to wonder what your past really was. Now, here's the thing. You may be doing this already, and you don't even know you're doing it. So it's not like you say, well, that's delusional.
