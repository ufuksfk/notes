## Highlights
* [[2023-12-05]] 15:33  You want to show your handbag to African American women between 25 and 35 who live in this part of the country and guess what? Suddenly you kind of can't. Well suddenly it becomes much more difficult to do that. And so that's sort of the sense of all cards thrown up in the air and then you've got all this new stuff happening as to well what would happen next? And one side of that is there's a sort of rush to people that maybe aren't or platforms or ways of advertising that aren't affected by that which gets you to things like merchant media or this so called first party data. And the other is there's as it might be 20 projects to try and build something that lets you show Nappy ads to people who are babies without using cookies and without knowing anything personal about them given that actually you don't need to. And the context for all of this is that global advertising last year was $650 to $700 billion and something like 400 $450,000,000,000 of that was digital so it's already more than half. And most of the rest is TV because obviously print and everything else have already flipped. And so what happens to all the TV as it goes online and what does that look like and what do the ad products look like and what are the formats and what are the platforms and how does that work? So that's a sort of, I don't know, 15 story elevator description of like everything's all fucked up and no one knows what happens next and it's $700. Billion and it's still a massive budget. It's also interesting to see our relationship to how our relationship to ads has evolved also over the years of just what we're comfortable receiving as an ad and what we're not. Like the organic stuff, what feels like an ad but isn't an ad, or what should be marked as an ad because it feels very discreet. There's a whole sort of ideological layer to this, which is that there's a certain kind of person that just thinks advertising in general is bad. I don't think that's actually very many people. There's a rather broader set of people that don't have a problem in principle with advertising, but have a problem with advertising based on who you are in any kind of a way.
