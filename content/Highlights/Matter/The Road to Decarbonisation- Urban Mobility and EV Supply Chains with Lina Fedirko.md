## Highlights
* [[2024-07-18]] 17:06  Well, not required. They’re sort of incentivized to price their product competitively with gasoline vehicles.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:00  But talk to me a little bit about how do we encourage more people to shift to EV’s.

* [[2024-07-18]] 18:09  I would recommend into looking into a couple of NGO’s that we work very closely with. And I’ll just name three. So one is Earthworks, based in the US, working globally around extractive issues, both on minerals and fossil fuels.

* [[2024-07-18]] 16:45  Just because I am so invested and I decide to get on the bike, you know, I might be riding for a day, but as soon as I get into an issue of unprotected bike lane, my behavior change will immediately be reversed because I’m fearing for my physical safety.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:05  And so if you’re mandating the automakers to not just produce, but to also sell these products, what happens is they are incentivized to shift their marketing budget, which is incredibly, incredibly high, from exclusively marketing their gasoline vehicles to also marketing EV’s.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:21  And it’s a huge kind of a collaborative effort between NGO’s and philanthropic partners as part of that work.

* [[2024-07-18]] 18:09  So one is Earthworks, based in the US, working globally around extractive issues, both on minerals and fossil fuels. Another one is Earth justice. They’re also based in the US.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:36  All of these other recognitions is sort of the geopolitics of everything, the resource nationalism, the resource motivated armed conflicts that are kind of surrounding some minerals discourse, trade restrictions and a lot of different sort of geopolitical levers that are increasing the complexity of this mineral space and are because it’s just making it more difficult for folks to figure out what to do next.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:35  We are struggling to develop and to secure economic prosperity for our citizens. So if we’re going to do this transition, and if you need our minerals, you kind of the wealthy countries, we need to think about how you help us move up the value chain and how, you know, the mineral rich countries really want to develop and expand their industrial capacity.

* [[2024-07-18]] 16:43  One thing that I’ll say is that whatever any advocate in this space, whether you’re working at the system change level or at behavior change, individual level, needs to understand that individual change and system change are two sides of the same coin.

* [[2024-07-18]] 14:02  And nowadays, I lead two of our initiatives here at Climateworks, one focusing on ev battery supply chain sustainability angle, and then the other one focusing on minerals for the energy transition.

* [[2024-07-18]] 14:10  One other piece that I wanted to share about what are kind of some urban mobility measures that cities can undertake and some that are testing them are one is a zero emission zone. So this is something that LA has been testing and a couple of other cities over the last several years.

* [[2024-07-18]] 14:47  And by doing so, you sort of, first of all, start with a zone where the air quality can see rapid improvements over time. And then you could sort of build that zone to expand to greater areas in the city.

* [[2024-07-18]] 16:44  So one particular case example I have for this is an organization in the Netherlands called bikes BYCs, and they are working across the globe to support and grow the culture of biking and working with different geographies to unpack what biking means, what are preconceptions around that mode of transportation, how it can benefit people in communities, or what are kind of challenges that are working with about that.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:23  So that initiative really starts to look into the question of what do we actually do about the fact that many, many raw materials, many more than we have today, are needed to build enough clean technologies in order to allow us to transition from fossil fuels.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:28  And so I wanted to share kind of five different points about this issue that we need to consider before then.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:29  Okay, so just a quick kind of a stat reminder for folks is that renewable energy sources are now projected to overtake coal for electricity generation by 2025.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:38  But in very simple terms, responsible mineral supply is not the status quo.

* [[2024-07-18]] 17:40  So one quick example of that could be a place like Chile. Chile is a major producer of copper and lithium, and they are really looking to benefit and build out and benefit from their resources to develop further.

* [[2024-07-18]] 18:09  They do a lot of work with indigenous and native peoples in the US and helping them bring lawsuits against various extractive companies when the communities have been bypassed. And then the third one is transport and environment, which is an NGO, prolific NGO in the EU that we work very closely with.
