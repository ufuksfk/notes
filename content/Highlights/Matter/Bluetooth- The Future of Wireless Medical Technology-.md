## Highlights
* [[2024-01-22]] 11:40  Bluetooth, while it is certainly not the universal solution to all wireless needs, addresses many of the performance requirements specific to medical applications, and it is a particularly good fit in use models demanding high mobility, long battery life, and no infrastructure support.

* [[2024-01-22]] 11:41  The Bluetooth specification was created jointly by Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia, and Toshiba and was named after the 10th- century Danish Viking king Harald "Bluetooth" Blatand, who united the warring factions of Denmark and Norway. A primary goal of the Bluetooth specification is to create a truly international standard to be implemented identically worldwide. So far, this goal is being met.

* [[2024-01-22]] 11:43  Today, Bluetooth technology has a following of more than 2500 companies. The initial founders have been joined by such companies as 3COM, Lucent, Microsoft, and Motorola.

* [[2024-01-22]] 11:43  Last year, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) adopted Bluetooth as the basis for its personal-area network (PAN) standard 802.15.

* [[2024-01-22]] 11:44  To achieve robust connections, Bluetooth employs three key techniques: frequency hopping, adaptive power control, and the transmission of short data packets.

* [[2024-01-22]] 11:44  Like other ISM radio technologies, Bluetooth operates in the 2.4–2.485-GHz radio band. Its radio meets the power and spectral emissions specifications defined by ETSI ETS 300–328 in Europe and FCC under CFR 47 Part 15 in the United States using the following set of parameters:
