## Highlights
* [[2024-02-26]] 12:26  It's not always necessarily a negative intention when developing technology, but really the idea is to manage and mitigate potential risk and to be inclusive to all communities.

* [[2024-02-26]] 12:27  And green ops in this scenario is essentially what DevOps is to developing green Ops is to the same idea. Like it's essentially operationalizing some of the kind of ice picks of green software.

* [[2024-02-26]] 18:01  But when CCF became, I think the first version that I saw actually had support for both AWS and a bit of Google Cloud and now it's actually got support for, like you said, all the big ones plus Alibaba. I didn't know about Alibaba, actually.

* [[2024-02-26]] 18:23  And what we've been really leaning into and even just Azure as well, because Azure has a different implementation where it's more API based instead of SQL based, like your Google Cloud bigquery or your AWS Athena, which we interact with for usage.

* [[2024-02-26]] 20:30  Because at the end of the day, it is a community supported and collaborative tool. And I think that's the biggest and strongest part of all, is that this isn't a methodology that one organization has owned or came up with, but that I want to say the entire industry who really cares about this subject has contributed and promoted growth within.
