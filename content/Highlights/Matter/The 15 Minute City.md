## Highlights
* [[2024-12-04]] 16:40  In February 2023, protesters took to the streets of Oxford, England. Many were wearing yellow safety vests and holding flags and signs with complaints about the local government. Specifically, they were protesting new urban planning policies being carried out by their city.

* [[2024-12-04]] 16:44  let's talk about where this planning concept originated. So this concept of a 15 minute city, it was first laid out by. This guy, Professor Carlos Moreno, Sorbono University researcher and creator of the 15 minute city concept. So Professor Moreno, he's this famous urbanist. He's from Colombia, but he's lived in France for a long time.

* [[2024-12-04]] 16:44  for centuries, towns and cities were laid out in this very central way. Like, you would have a town square with shops and amenities in the center, and then people would kind of encircle that. But in the 20th century, that changed with the advent of modernism and the rise of certain very influential architects.

* [[2024-12-04]] 16:46  second major trend, which is the rise of cars. The automotive city is a very short period in the history of cities. This again is Professor Carlos Moreno. Massive production of cars has started when Mr. Henry Ford has produced the first Model T. The worldwide presence of massive car is just after the second war.

* [[2024-12-04]] 16:48  do have a supermarket, I do have a pub, I don't have a hospital, et cetera. You can work through it and immediately it becomes humanized. You think, what do I need, what do I have and what do I lack? And to be clear, it's pretty unrealistic to have everything within a 15 minute walking distance. And Professor Moreno totally acknowledges this.

* [[2024-12-04]] 16:48  This is not a question to build a louvre museum every 15 minutes. This is not a question to build a cancerous hospital every 50 minutes.

* [[2024-12-06]] 20:37  So in the wake of COVID we're seeing lots of cities passing resolutions and saying, you know, we want to be 15 minute cities. We want to be more like 15 minute cities. So Buenos Aires, busan in south Korea. It's not just big cities, though. It's not just global capitals.

* [[2024-12-06]] 20:37  Yeah, it doesn't sound like you have a lot in common besides your alma mater. No, no. But New Year's Eve 2022, Jordan Peterson tweets some charts about the 15 Minute City and the Great Reset. So he's amplifying this, right? And he adds a quote saying, the Great.

* [[2024-12-06]] 20:37  Okay. The idea that neighborhood should be walkable is lovely. The idea that idiot tyrannical bureaucrats can decide by fiat where you're allowed to drive is perhaps the worst imaginable perversion of this idea. So this keeps going. It keeps spreading all over the place.

* [[2024-12-06]] 20:37  The idea they're, they're starting, starting to roll out in Europe. It seems to me that they're using the climate change narrative to will have travel restricted. I mean, one of the ironic things about this, to me, in this like, whole mischief is that the 15 minute city doesn't strike me as a left wing idea at all.

* [[2024-12-06]] 20:38  So October 2023, Mark Harper is the transportation minister. Not for long, as it turns out. And he starts Talking about the 15 Minute City and he starts talking a lot like these protesters. What is different, what is sinister and what we shouldn't tolerate is the idea that local councils can decide how often you go to the shops and that they ration who uses the roads and when, and they police it all with cctv. I mean, this is so ridiculous.

* [[2024-12-06]] 20:38  These are not serious thinkers. These are not serious men. No. No, they're not. And it's all coming to a head as cities are trying to implement policies to become more like a 15 minute city.
