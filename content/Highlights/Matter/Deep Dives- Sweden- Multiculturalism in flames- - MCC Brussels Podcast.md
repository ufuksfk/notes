## Highlights
* [[2024-11-20]] 23:19  Aside from reporting on what happened, is there nobody in the news section who wants to do analysis and ask some of the tough questions?

* [[2024-11-20]] 23:31  But then on the other hand, you see polarization in mass media, for instance, where newspapers that used to be, you know, right wing liberal or even conservative like Svenska Dogblade are now being filled more and more with, I'm not saying woke people and multiculturalists, but people, journalists who seem to somehow more and more and more buying into that rhetoric. So the media landscape in Sweden, if you talk about, you know, the classic media landscape is I would say to 85, 90% dominated by, by journalists and articles where, you know, they are praising diversity and they keep doing it. And you know, this is also an interesting thing because if you just check the facts, if you just, I mean, this is something we should, we'll talk more about, I guess. But if you just check crime statistics like what I've been writing about, you have the figures there. Yeah.

* [[2024-11-20]] 23:32  Could you talk us through, especially numbers wise, what went from being something that it's a good thing we're taking in refugees to mass immigration? Well, I think, you know, Sweden became officially a multicultural society in, I think it was 1971, because that year we decided, it was a kind of government report that we, from now on we are supposed to allow migrants to keep living their own life and they shouldn't be tainted by Swedish culture and Swedish modernity and so forth. So that is supposed to be the year 71.

* [[2024-11-20]] 23:24  I think Orwell said that the racist, one day the racist will come back under the guise of anti racists. And I think this fits exactly perfectly in the Swedish society today because now we have all these DO gurus, mostly left wingers, but not only actually, but mostly left wingers who are going on precisely like that, pampering migrants and treating them like they are, you know, infantile, you know, toddlers.

* [[2024-11-20]] 23:32  Integration wasn't there. How do we look numbers wise then over the years? Well, that's hard to say, but everything exploded in the 1990s and then we had the refugee crisis in 2015. And now I would say we have a situation. I think we have around 2 million migrants in Sweden and the numbers have gone up drastically over the last years.

* [[2024-11-22]] 08:53  She said, so the point is that maybe Sweden is a place attracting not the most clever, not the most law abiding migrants. And I have to say this because sometimes you end up in stereotyping and I don't like that because when I lived in Jordan I met so many young guys, so many people, and most of them were nice people, you know. So I just want to say this because we shouldn't simplify matters. No, because all migrants are not crooked, of course. No, but I think what she said, and she smiled as she said it because it seems as if for her and her husband this was obvious. If you have a society and the society is pampering migrants, you're likely to end up with crooks and criminals and bastards and murderers.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:40  Yeah. So Swedish values, you know, strangely enough, seem to. We need to drop it, because otherwise we can't keep on praising mass immigration by migrants, especially mass immigration by Muslims. So, I mean. And again, I say we, but I'm not talking about. I'm not talking about the majority. Of course I'm not.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:40  I'm talking about a thin sliver, a thin slice of Swedish society, namely a few 10,000 people with influence, you know, professors and, you know, academics and politicians who are setting the boundaries and setting the rules of the game.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:44  But if you would be faced with, if you couldn't avoid the fact that Sweden is a great place and you know, you take one of these things like the emancipation of women in Sweden, it's a fabulous thing and we need to stick to it, we need to defend it and anybody who would like even to try to fiddle with it, you know, we'd punish that person ferociously.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:46  Why can't you dress a little bit more modestly?

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:46  And so what they are doing then these feminists they are buying into rhetoric which is not Swedish.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:46  I see certain people and certain women in Sweden who are starting to wear some kind of thing over their head. So I don't know. And these are Swedish. These are not Muslim. These are Swedish ladies who are starting to. It's like you can see these trends where it's influencing.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:47  would say that we have, over the last 20 years, witnessed, what do you call it, groundswell, a huge transformation of the political landscape in Sweden.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:48  Sweden Democrats is also a reflection of that, because the other parties, they were, you know, they were carrying on as if business as usual, and they failed to recognize what's going on.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:50  situation with maximum tension between the elites and the people, then you could just have a look at what's been going on in Sweden over the last 20 years.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:53  Social Democrats where they showed a certain amount of self reflection and they, for, you know, they started almost talking like in Yokosam, you know, to having a kind of quite, I don't know, using another language, saying things like, we need to save Sweden and our culture, culture and you know, equality between men and women is worth rescuing and so forth.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:54  talked to a lady yesterday about. She wrote a book. It's called why Woke One? And. Yeah, good book. Yeah. But I. And then I told her. I told her I don't believe. So I think woke has to lose because there's nothing in it and it's against,

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:54  multiculturalism has to lose because everything shows that this is a model of society that doesn't work,

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:54  nations, they emerge for a reason.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:55  people assembled and then they started having, you know, common memories, history, language, and so forth.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:55  multiculturalism is like the idea that, okay, we just ignore all that and then we put everything together and then we shake it really bad, and then it's going to be wonderful.

* [[2024-11-21]] 07:56  Multiculturalism, Sweden's Rude Awakening.
