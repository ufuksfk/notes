## Highlights
* [[2024-10-03]] 12:55  There is nothing like you cannot. That’s why all this underwater things, they try to invent some new things.

* [[2024-10-03]] 12:37  That’s why it’s also very important to place your antenna so that you can have very efficient way of using this ground plane.

* [[2024-10-03]] 12:17  I think also iPhone twelve was a total disaster because it worked badly if you hold it in the wrong way, according to Apple, of course. But yeah, it’s always user mistake.

* [[2024-10-03]] 12:54  And you cannot anymore use that antenna. That was kind of, you thought about it as it was like in the vacuum, you know, and then you take it in your hand and it’s not the same antenna anymore.

* [[2024-10-03]] 12:56  So yeah, it’s very challenging and you always need to take into account your user case in this sense then a lot of things coming from that.

* [[2024-10-04]] 17:16  So that’s why, like, it’s forgiven. But if you happen to have some very fancy material, like some resin or something like that, then you, out of sudden, you.

* [[2024-10-04]] 17:06  Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. So you said troubleshooting. So maybe could you lay out the tools that you use when you are in a situation where this antenna isn’t performing as expected and you have simulation at your disposal, but maybe other troubleshooting elements that you use to then back calculate what might be the problem.

* [[2024-10-04]] 16:55  But now nobody talks about that anymore because everybody got just disappointed. Yeah, because it’s very, very, it’s completely different technology, it’s completely different frequency, it’s.

* [[2024-10-04]] 16:56  It like software development but also it’s still new frequencies, some frequency bandst, sure you still need to update antennas, but it’s very comparable to what you have now if you want to update to millimeter waves, it’s completely, everything’s different.

* [[2024-10-04]] 17:14  So the antenna itself, okay. Is supposed to use like that in this way that it’s bent one time and you just keep it like that’s this way.

* [[2024-10-04]] 08:30  And also one antenna has very, very wide radiation pattern. Just radiate everywhere usually. So for example, if you imagine dipole or monopole, it’s just like around everywhere.

* [[2024-10-04]] 17:13  Yeah, that’s another good, good rule to have there. Does it matter then you still, the ground plane size still matters though as well, right? So you’re tiny device.

* [[2024-10-04]] 08:32  And they all combine together and create one beam and then you steer it. Some antennas steer mechanically, so actually turn in mechanically, but it’s not so used nowadays.

* [[2024-10-03]] 12:19  Yeah, harder. Interesting, really harder because they require bigger ground plane to work to radiate efficiently.

* [[2024-10-03]] 12:35  And returning back to why lower frequencies is harder because we want to keep devices small as possible. But the lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength.

* [[2024-10-04]] 08:11  Because it's. Well we kind of come from 100% water. Yeah. Now we come to 80% water. So yeah, it's very challenging and you always need to take into account your user case in this sense then a lot of things coming from that.

* [[2024-10-04]] 08:25  Because ceramics is super, super high, the electric constant and the higher the electric constant you have like substrate. Right. So usually you use kafir four, the cheapest one, and it has four 4.4 dielectric construct epsilon.

* [[2024-10-04]] 08:28  If you saw, not this post, but last week post I posted about new AirPods and they have exactly this LDS technology and antenna like I showed there how this antenna looks like.

* [[2024-10-04]] 16:54  So millimeter waves are slowly coming now to, you know, we have now five g and there are two types of 5g, normal 5g that is just faster than four g and then like super, super 5g, that is millimeter waves. And several years ago when we were very hyped for this millimeter wave 5g, everybody were talking about that, everybody were like planning what we will do, like we will stream our holograms or whatever with this 5g.

* [[2024-10-04]] 16:57  So it will go like 1 meter and then nothing. So you really need mesh of these base stations and then you.

* [[2024-10-04]] 17:00  Oh, se. Yeah, so not EMC like electromagnetic compatibility, but ems, so, yeah, so, yeah, visualizing.
