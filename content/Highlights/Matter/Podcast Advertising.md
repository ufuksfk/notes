* [[2023-12-04]] 18:14  Now, Apple podcast is one of the few places that actually supports if you put a PDF in there, but Libsyn actually does support that. So we do fully support audio, video and PDF. From a simpler point of view, I just say you're not a podcast if you don't have an RSS feed and you aren't in Apple podcasts.

* [[2023-12-04]] 18:16  Some other companies try to lock things down, have shows that are just exclusive on them, but Apple's never been about that, and that's been a good for everybody.

* [[2023-12-04]] 18:17  And IAB stands for Interactive Advertising Bureau. And those are the kind of the standard of podcast stats. And you want to be on a host that is IAB certified.

And when the iOS eight came out and the Apple Podcast app was native in the iPhone and you couldn't delete it, a lot of people asked, what is this purple app and why can't I delete it?
