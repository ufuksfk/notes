## Highlights
* [[2024-11-13]] 23:29  And so that also can tell us a bit about the properties. One of the properties of being at the top right corner, it means it loves electron density, really wants to pull electron density towards it.

* [[2024-11-13]] 23:49  I feel like that's such a great visual for our listeners. So you said sulfur and that refers to the S in SF6. Yeah. And you've described a bit what fluorine is like as a component.

* [[2024-11-13]] 23:49  What is sulfur like? How would you describe sulfur in the periodic table? It's actually structured in such an intelligent way. We get information from the rows that the element is in the periodic table and the columns. And so Sulfur is just 1 below oxygen on the periodic table.

* [[2024-11-13]] 23:48  When we have a lot of high global warming potential molecules in the atmosphere, those molecules absorb that heat and can re irradiate it. So you almost get this ricochet effect where it's kind of bouncing between these molecules in the atmosphere back to Earth, back to the molecules, back to Earth. So that heat isn't getting dissipated into space, it's staying around the Earth and slowly contributing to increase in temperature. Would a sort of fair visual be almost as if you have two mirrors exactly. Sort of facing each other, is that right?

* [[2024-11-13]] 23:48  And so the first one is how much heat it can absorb, and the other is how much of it is in the atmosphere. Funny enough, water vapor is actually a really strong greenhouse gas because it can absorb a lot of heat. But as we've all learned in school, water in oceans and rivers gets vaporized a little bit into the atmosphere, then it condenses in clouds and it comes down as snow or rain. That cycle is actually relatively very short. So it mitigates the amount of time that these water vapors in the atmosphere. So it absorbs heat very well, but it doesn't stick around for very long. Right now, SF6 is not that situation. SF6 is very good at absorbing heat, and it stays in the atmosphere for a very long time.

* [[2024-11-13]] 23:50  So when we mix all these different gases together, we get the same functional properties required that we would for SF6. The difference is, as we were again talking global warming potential. Our ecogas has one fluorinated gas in it, C Fluoronitrile. This gas dissipates in the environment in 30 years and it degrades into readily available natural byproducts. So the lifetime is relatively low in comparison to SF6. SF6 stays around for over 3,000 years in the environment. So when we do a comparison, you can really see that not all F gases are the same. There's even nuance between this category F gas.

* [[2024-11-13]] 23:46  Hitachi Energy, we have strict procedures for how equipment is handled at end of product life. We also have high product lifespans. A lot of our products are meant to last 60 years and they're only operated by trained professionals.

* [[2024-11-14]] 08:47  I think I would have to pull from a book I love by Adam Grant called Think Again Now. He encourages us to think like scientists.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:16  I love that empowers us all to be a scientist and gather information from various sources and inspect where the data is coming from or who's paying for it, et cetera. Absolutely. And I think when we think about Instagram and TikTok. The goal for those individuals isn't to give you accurate, representative information. It's to keep you on the app and to keep you engaged.
