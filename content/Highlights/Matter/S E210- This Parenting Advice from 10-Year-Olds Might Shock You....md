* [[2025-01-04]] 23:14  Last time you applied for a job, you had a resume in our level. You're 10 years old, and you've already applied for jobs that you've had to submit resumes for. Tell me what you did. How did that work?

* [[2025-01-04]] 23:14  I mean, like, it's alpha weird. Like, different. And so it's Alpha weird. Yeah. Our school is different than traditional schools and is meant to prepare you for when you're an adult.

* [[2025-01-04]] 23:13  You guys are so good. Wait, I want to know if there's any more parenting advice. What other parenting advice do you have? Make sure your kids clean. Yeah. Make sure your kids know how to do their laundry and, like, wash the dishes. Yeah. Because else it's going to be, like, really hard in the future and they're going to have to, like, hire a cleaner person. And then, like, that will cost more.

* [[2025-01-04]] 23:13  Money that you don't necessarily need to spend. And this also will teach you, like, responsibility. I think you guys could host a podcast for parents on how to raise great kids. Yeah. And I think you should interview your parents.

* [[2025-01-04]] 23:13  What are some of the logical fallacies? Well, a logical fallacy is basically a problem with someone's argument. So there's a slippery slope, which is one event will lead to a long and bad chain of events. And then there's ad hominem, which is attacking someone's personal information rather than the argument. Some of the other ones are strawman red herring. Appeal to tradition, appeal to authority, appeal to popularity, genetic policy, and there's lots more. Wow, you guys, Are you serious? I need to go to this school.
