## Highlights
* [[2024-11-08]] 07:38  I don't think the US Dollar is going anywhere. And I think the debt situation in the United States, while not my ideal, is not the thing that's going to tear down the US Dollar at all.

* [[2024-11-08]] 07:38  BRICS Alliance? Wrong word. BRICS Organization. It's not even that. BRICS Association. There we go.

* [[2024-11-08]] 07:39  It really hasn't gone beyond that. Certainly countries haven't signed on to alternatives, largely because they really aren't any. The biggest one would have been the European euro. But when they started using insured banks deposits to pay for bailouts 15 years ago, everyone got out of the euro. So now it's a regional currency.

* [[2024-11-08]] 07:41  But Russia's under sanctions, so don't bring your visa or your MasterCard, they won't work. There may be a handful like single digit number of places in town that will use a Chinese charge card, but we really don't like that system either. So you really shouldn't count on that. You're gonna have to use cash. However, it's really hard to get rubles outside of Russia these days. Again, sanctions. So what you need to do is come with hard currency.
