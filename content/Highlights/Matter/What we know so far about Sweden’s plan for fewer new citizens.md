She was 87 years old when she died, so she had a long and rich life. She left Sweden at a quite a young age when she married. But before she left Sweden, she was known in Sweden as the Haga Sessur. That means the Haga princesses. They lived in Haga palace, which is now Crown Princess Victoria's house is where.
