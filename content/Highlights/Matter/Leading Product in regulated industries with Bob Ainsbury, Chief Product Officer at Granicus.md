## Highlights
* [[2024-12-22]] 23:04  So if you get emails from your city or maybe Affordable Care act is in full go right now for healthcare.gov, those emails flow through us and we send these at a massive scale. We got like 7,000, 8,000 customers, something like that. So we send over. I think it's 23, correction, our customers send over using our system. 23 billion communications a year.

* [[2024-12-21]] 10:09  And then you say, well, how many are using Google Maps or Maps, how many are using Spotify in the evenings? How many are using Netflix choices?

* [[2024-12-21]] 10:10  And so AIML for government has profound potential, even more in the private sector really quickly.

* [[2024-12-22]] 23:04  Well, if you go look at drone legislation, you'll find it will point back to one organization who did drone regulations at the local level first and did it very thoughtfully. So there's kind of a leader and a follower approach to how it propagates, but otherwise. Yes. Okay, so I have a more general question. It might be outside of building for, for government as customers, but still kind of in the regulation compliance space.

* [[2024-12-22]] 23:04  So. So granicus.com is the best place. Head over to granicus.com no matter what country you're in, you'll get to the right granicus instance from granisys.com it'll redirect you. And for me personally, just go to LinkedIn. Got an odd name that not many people have, so search for Bob Amesbury on LinkedIn and you'll find a strange headline.
