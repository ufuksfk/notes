## Highlights
* [[2024-06-16]] 18:29  Lisa is also the author of the renowned book Thermal Delight in Architecture and the most recently published book, Visual Delight in Architecture, along with many groundbreaking technical publications about daylighting and energy efficiency in buildings.

* [[2024-06-16]] 18:41  Well, you have to remember that thermal delight was written by a 25 year old graduate student 40 years ago.

* [[2024-06-16]] 18:51  You know, we've also been asking, are there cultural differences in appetite for daylight? And really, we don't have good discipline studies looking at cultural differences.

* [[2024-06-16]] 18:55  I think that certainly in the past, most electric lighting designers were trained to design as if the windows weren't there or to design the space for nighttime use, which is fine because we need light at night.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:09  And similarly, people that are confined indoors because of a health problem or disability are especially vulnerable.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:11  I've been particularly impressed with what I think of as the european approach, or maybe it's the british approach of asking for a three layered view, meaning sky, ground, and everything in between.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:16  So we're on this sort of slippery slope where the technology and the venture capitalists are really eager to develop a product that they can sell. And I've been trying to tell architects that they're selling your product, right?

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:21  So I take it apart in my book, and it's so bad, it's almost funny, but it's also tragic because it had quite an influence on generations of students who had to go to school in those schools.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:23  I was working primarily in energy efficiency, and there was a brief period of time when the funders of that, which is the utility companies and Utility Commission in California, believed in something called market transformation, which for them meant that if we could show there were benefits to energy efficiency measures above and beyond the cost savings of the energy, then we would have faster adoption, and we want to do whatever we can to speed up adoption of energy efficiency measures.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:38  So I used that argument to propose this study looking at daylighting and proposing that if indeed there were non energy benefits, such as better school performance or better retail sales or better cognitive performance of office workers, that that would help speed the adoption of the energy efficiency benefits of daylighting.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:40  Well, the evidence is that spending more time outside is enormously beneficial, especially for children who have attention issues, and that having stronger circadian stimulus, whether it's time outside or through more daylight and more views, is also highly beneficial.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:43  Well, there's also growing evidence that exposure to the outdoors, exposure to daylight, is very important to reduce the prevalence of myopia.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:43  Children's eyes are growing through childhood and adolescence, and myopia seems to be a circadian malady.

* [[2024-06-17]] 18:44  So, for example, it's being able to see in San Francisco, it's being able to see the Golden Gate bridge in Paris, it's being able to see the Eiffel Tower. And if that element is within the view, all of a sudden the property is infinitely more valuable.
