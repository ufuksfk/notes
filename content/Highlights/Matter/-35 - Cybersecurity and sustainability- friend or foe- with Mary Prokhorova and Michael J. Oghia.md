## Highlights
* [[2024-04-07]] 11:39  Quite a lot to cover in this episode, so I wanted to bring two experts on board, Mary and Michael, with different angles of approach. Mary Prohova is the founder and CEO of Inev Flab and also the cofounder of Sevi five, which is specialized in cybersecurity product.

* [[2024-04-07]] 11:44  And while this manufacturing was stopped, I mean, logistics was stopped, production was stopped, a lot of plastic was broken.

* [[2024-04-07]] 11:46  It only happened because of often malicious actors, whether state or non state. And thus it's just one more layer to our very complicated, complex world that we live in that I think is very relevant to this discussion.

* [[2024-04-07]] 11:52  But obviously, when you start with this first layer and actually this fifth layer that Mary described, using that much personal equipment might be good for the planet, might be good for environment, but that causes some issues with cybersecurity.

* [[2024-04-07]] 11:55  On the other hand, too, getting a refurbished device can also come with its own positives, such as a lot of times older devices have a lot fewer bugs because those bugs have already been worked out.

* [[2024-04-07]] 11:56  But on the other hand, what you also say is in general and the devil in the details, but in general, the older the better in terms of cybersecurity.

* [[2024-04-07]] 15:11  Because we already have examples where environmental pollution is either being caused or could be caused by either the hacking of something like a dam, a hydroelectric dam, I mean.

* [[2024-04-07]] 15:45  First, I would be remiss if I didn't say that there's a lot of really interesting things happening on both the security side and the sustainability side within the Nordics. I've been working on the Nordics for the past two years. The nordic data center sector is growing exponentially and it's combining a lot of really good natural features such as its cold climate, with really good people who are working on things like integrating data center heat waste into the district utility grids who are working on a lot of innovation.
