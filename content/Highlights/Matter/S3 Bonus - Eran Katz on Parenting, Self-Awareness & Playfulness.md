## Highlights
* [[2024-12-30]] 10:29  It started as a blog and then I don't remember when I started this podcast. It's called the apparently parent Podcast. It was the apparently parent blog. So it was the apparently parent podcast, which ran for 60 something episodes

* [[2024-12-30]] 10:29  But I just wanted to say I love that you're focusing on that. As a father, I know the importance of this because when my kids are dysregulated, when they've got their shit coming up, it often will trigger mine. Like, oh, they're doing something and it triggers my own stuff. And the parenting moments that I'm least proud of are the moments when I was not able to deal with my own emotions in response to theirs. And I've gotten a lot better at that. This is a lot of the work that I've done for myself. I'm not perfect, but I definitely have done a lot better. And the more that I can do that for myself as you said, the more we can be there for them in the way that they need, and as you know, we're modeling something for them of how to regulate ourselves.

* [[2024-12-30]] 10:28  And I said, oh, how's that been going for you? And he says, oh, I've been taking courses and reading books. And he's like, I've taken 20 courses on how to be a writer. And I'm like, oh, that's interesting. How many more do you think you'll need before you feel like, you know, really confident in that? And the answer is never. Like, you'll never be able to take enough courses to feel confident in putting your writing out there. So I can. I love that you shared that. And I think it's really good for people to check in, like, am I procrastinating on actually creating something by reading and taking courses and those kinds of things?

* [[2024-12-30]] 10:28  Since you're a visual learner and I imagine there's a lot of others too. Right. Imagine there's this circle. At the top of the circle we had a belief or a fear which is like this course is going to fall flat and I am going to be a disappointment from that belief or fear. We have actions, we go down this side of the Circle. And on this side of the circle there was, I'm going to watch Netflix do anything other than work on this really meaningful thing. And then the results would be on this side of the circle. And it would be, I'll finish the Netflix series, but I'm not going to do this really meaningful thing to me, this thing that I really care about and achieve stuff for my family that really matters to me. And then after that there's like a way that you feel and there's like we heard a really harsh voice and you know, says you never, you never finish anything and a bunch of other things and they reinforce an idea. One of them is a belief that you never get. You never finish things. Right. Never get things done. Except for Netflix series. But there's the other one that I'm pointing to, which is the original one, which is I'm a disappointment.
