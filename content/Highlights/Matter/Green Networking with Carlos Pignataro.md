## Highlights
* [[2024-12-12]] 15:40  I’m going to talk about something you wouldn’t necessarily speak space at the moment, but one of the things that interests me, and we mention it a lot in building green software, is that networking is one of the few areas of the tech industry where there’s already been a lot of thoughts which is directly aligned with with energy saving that networking has a concept of. Is it bits per watts or watts per bit? Yeah.

* [[2024-12-12]] 15:56  Something that you’ve said in your papers, you talked a lot about was the efficiency of flattening peaks in load, peaks in demand. It’s much better if you could spread demand, find some clever way of spreading demand out so that you don’t have peaks that you have to provision for, because that means you need more equipment and more of everything.

* [[2024-12-12]] 15:38  And the interesting thing there is that when we look at the overall life cycle of networking and software, we have the use phase within the lifecycle that focuses on the specific operations of the network.

* [[2024-12-12]] 15:44  If we add more links, we can have more redundancy. And if we add more routers to actually duplicate that and more links between them, we have even more redundancy. And that redundancy of resiliency in plouf asymptotically gets to a point in which I add more.

* [[2024-12-12]] 15:47  And we call that the footprint, or AI systems that are AI for sustainability, meaning the output of the system can actually help you with sustainable outcomes. And we call that the handprint.

* [[2024-12-12]] 16:04  And I think that AI as a broad technology from whatever from machine learning and computer vision has moved significantly into going AI for sustainability. We have Google Maps today that can actually give me the most sustainable travel fuel efficient route. And I go in to book my flights and I see carbon to each one of those.
