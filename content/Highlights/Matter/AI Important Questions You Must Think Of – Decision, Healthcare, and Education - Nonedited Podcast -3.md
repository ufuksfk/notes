## Highlights
* [[2024-11-20]] 14:27  Now usually humans do that in a split second decision. When it comes to AI, it does that very quickly as well, but it does it statistically, not emotionally. So it could choose for example to save an elderly person rather than a young person, which is not a problem. But some people might not like it. They did a bit of a research, an online game called Morality Machine.

* [[2024-11-20]] 14:27  It's a project, you could google it if you're interested to see how people react to such situations. And in western countries people were more likely to save an elderly person than a young person, women more than men in other cultures as well, or this is predominant across many cultures. So the truth is some people have biases and artificial intelligence does not have that bias.

* [[2024-11-20]] 14:28  So that's another thing when it comes to trusting AI with our lives. A good use case would also Alphabet, which is Google's Isomorphic Labs collaborating with Novartis. It's a medical pharmaceutical company on AI driven drug discovery. I was researching recently the healthcare market and specifically the drug industry how long it takes. Apparently it takes around five years for a company to think of a, to get the medicine or the drug out to actual testing from experimentation or from the beginning phases.

* [[2024-11-20]] 14:28  Another would be the founders of Anchor. Anchor is a website that deals with podcasts and they sold their company to Spotify to go build something called oboi. I'm not sure if I'm even saying this correctly, but it is kind of an AI educational startup. They sold it for around 340 million. And I mean it was distributed amongst two companies, but at the end they're, they're now building products aimed and quoting them as well.
