## Highlights
* [[2024-10-08]] 08:49  But 25% of my clients, they have internal standards that they want to meet, and they’re always performance driven.

* [[2024-10-08]] 08:49  However, the electrical drive system is so efficient that there is only a little amount of excessive heat. It’s not enough to heat up the bus.

* [[2024-10-08]] 09:00  Doesn’t really know or not depth experience on the EMC.

* [[2024-10-08]] 08:40  Was it a difficult transition for you to go from doing, I think, you know, front end engineering and systems design, then getting into EMI and EMC? Because I ask that, because I think for a lot of designers, you know, they come from kind of the classic ee education, where it’s a lot of circuit design and maybe not enough of electromagnetics, which is some of the background that you would need for EMI, EMC, Si and PI, all those areas kind of interrelated.
