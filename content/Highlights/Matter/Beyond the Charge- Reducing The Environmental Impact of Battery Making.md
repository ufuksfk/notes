## Highlights
* [[2024-03-23]] 16:28  When people drive a car, if you have leasing battery, it's very clean, very quiet. But the process to make a leasing battery can be dirty.

* [[2024-03-23]] 16:32  And it take maybe only 50% of energy required to make a conventional batteries if you use a dry process.

* [[2024-03-23]] 16:39  And maybe I can talk because we're dealing with powders and particles, how to manage them and put them onto the current collector, require some art and require some engineering, require a lot of physics. So that part is more complex. But overall it is something.

* [[2024-03-23]] 16:39  And right now, I have to confess, the uniformity of the material is not as good as the electrode made with a web process. That is something we have to improve.

* [[2024-03-23]] 16:49  I think I saw that 44% of the energy in the EU in 2023 came from renewables, and that's just because. Oh, that's a very high. Yeah. And it's because there's been this massive investment off the back.
