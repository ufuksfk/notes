## Highlights
* [[2024-06-20]] 12:19  Thank you for having me. My name is Kathleen Biggins, and I am the president and founder of Seachange Conversation.

* [[2024-06-20]] 12:26  Before moving to Spain, I co founded Hyper Energy Efficient data center Cork Internet exchange between 2006 and 2008.

* [[2024-06-20]] 12:36  Like, one of the things we point out in conservative places is that Ronald Reagan took some of the biggest climate action of any president ever up until modern times, and that is when he worked to protect the ozone layer.

* [[2024-06-20]] 14:52  I'm Jim Herzfeld, host of the what if so what podcast, where we discover what's possible with digital and figure out how to make it real by asking, what if so what?

* [[2024-06-20]] 17:23  And what do you account for that success? How credible the messaging is and how credible our messengers are.

* [[2024-06-20]] 17:49  Yeah, I have a very practical example of that, because where I live, here in Spain, in Andalucia, it's the prime area for the production of olive oil.
