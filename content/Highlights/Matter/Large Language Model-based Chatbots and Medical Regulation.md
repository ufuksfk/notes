## Highlights
* [[2024-04-17]] 12:53  We'll put the link in the chat here about how large language model AI chatbots require approval as medical device camera natural medicine, June of 2023, which, you know, in this universe is, what, seven months after the start of the field.

* [[2024-04-17]] 12:58  It has the title, I kind of paraphrase slightly, I make it a word out of place, but large language model applications in medicine are regulated as medical devices.

* [[2024-04-17]] 13:11  We make this suggestion, which I think is somewhat controversial, that medical large language models would be superior.

* [[2024-04-17]] 13:13  So clearly a problem is if your device is answering anything based on any input for any purpose, this is going to be very, very challenging for you to get approval as a medical advice in a european framework.

* [[2024-04-17]] 13:14  Almost certainly not, you know, it's not a good, you know, winning, you know, you're not going to get the clients, it's going to be the person who says, yeah, no problem, it's easy. We haven't yet seen the approved devices in Europe in order to make the comparison, and as you're probably aware, in Europe as well, because we've got a rather fragmented system, it could be that some devices get approved from some notified bodies when we could have the same situation with another notified body, perhaps in another country with effectively the same submission, but we wouldn't even know that it was the same submission, gets a very different answer.

* [[2024-04-19]] 12:51  If I'd asked you the same question, are there on market clinical decision support systems using large language models in Europe at the moment or in the UK at the moment, would the answer be yes or no?

* [[2024-04-19]] 12:54  And this has been subject to questions that have been put to regulatory authorities, and regulatory authorities have actually provided answers in Europe, and the answer has been quite clear from regulatory authorities that chat GPT is not a medical device, that bard is not a medical device for the very clear reason of intended purpose.

* [[2024-04-21]] 19:33  It's like, that's okay for the US, but it's completely. We don't accept that in Europe, because this intelligence application to medicine is completely not allowed in our frameworks.

* [[2024-04-21]] 19:34  Are we competing in Europe in the level where we can actually develop technologies? If we have a company like Mistral and Paris? But if we have a situation where we have companies even starting in Europe, do they have to move to the US to really have any traction to actually we developing?

* [[2024-04-21]] 19:35  But in the world of the savages, it's kind of a region where the technology changes and advantages are not introduced. And as much as I wouldn't want the brave new world vision, that's as disturbing as the savage vision.

* [[2024-04-21]] 19:37  And in Europe, the line is generalists cannot exist because generalists cannot be taken through design controls in a traditional manner as initially designed for implants.

* [[2024-04-21]] 19:44  I attend last week meetings in Brussels about the application of AI technologies and Social Security assessments or working capacity assessment.
