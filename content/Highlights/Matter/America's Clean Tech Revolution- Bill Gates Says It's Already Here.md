## Highlights
* [[2024-11-20]] 14:34  One of the greatest problems we have in getting to zero is that we generate weather dependent energy sources. Solar and wind are not constant. One of the interesting things about that is buildings can often shift their energy load across the 24 hour period, can take the electricity when it's available, lower cost, different times, and either have a cold store or heat store or chemical store or battery store. But it requires participation of all those different groups to come together in the context of buildings. Intelligent building controls.

* [[2024-11-19]] 16:10  We're learning this all the time as we support customers and advance our own company. Net zero goal. We need to be part of an ecosystem, and I'll also share that. One of our most successful partnerships has been with a breakthrough energy company called Luxwall. This is a company that offers an alternative to traditional glass for windows, one that can reduce energy usage by up to 45%. We're now starting to install these windows in our own facilities.
