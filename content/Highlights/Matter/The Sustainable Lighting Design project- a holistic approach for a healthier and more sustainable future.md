## Highlights
* [[2024-06-16]] 10:11  Now you specify a lot of products that are, or promise to be circular in the future, and then you sort of forget the other aspects, which is actually to design lighting for people and for their needs. And I think in this equation, what we miss is actually ask the people, how do they feel?

* [[2024-06-16]] 10:13  However, when they actually asked the people about how they perceived the daylight, no one actually reported that they have any issues with glare, but that they actually appreciated that the sunlight was coming in and that they would take the samples and actually directly view it under the direct daylight and so on.

* [[2024-06-16]] 10:27  But talking just about that, I mean, we do have four main focuses in our project, which is health and well being, light pollution, energy efficiency and circularity.

* [[2024-06-16]] 10:51  Is it the company where we bought it or is it the owners of the building and so on? Because this also is part of sustainability, because if it's very hard to maintain or to change, then it's not sustainable.
