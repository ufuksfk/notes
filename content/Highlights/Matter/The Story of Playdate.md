## Highlights
* [[2024-07-30]] 12:57  But hardware is, you know, is hardware and it gets made in a factory and then it gets sent out to people and you no longer have any control over it. And that’s scary. It’s a first time for us and we’re trying very hard to do it right.

* [[2024-07-30]] 13:04  Each one of these pieces of test equipment has its own way of telling you what it’s seeing or what values it’s wanting you to know about.

* [[2024-07-30]] 13:02  Then adjacent to the on device software and firmware, there’s the software development kit, or SDK, that game developers use to write their code, and playdate emulators for Mac and PC, where game developers can run, test, and debug that code. And then there’s the software that runs on completely separate devices, on the actual playdate assembly line, devices that run diagnostic tests at different points of production.

* [[2024-07-30]] 12:54  It’s about zero latency, muscle memory, and you need to feel that you are in instant control of everything that happens and that tactility, however you solve it, if it’s like pressing a button or turning a knob or a Crankley, it’s very important for the whole experience and the joy of being, you know, like in control and using your hands.

* [[2024-07-30]] 12:27  But part of the reason I think why panic is panic, and one of the reasons why we never so far haven’t sold the company or taken investments or stuff like that is because we really appreciate the freedom of being able to do weird things, adventures and strange side projects, and just having total creative freedom without having to be beholden to anyone or make a lot of sense or, you know, justify everything.

* [[2024-07-30]] 12:30  You could buy different game and watch devices with different games on them, but no matter which ones you had, your brother was always playing the good one on the family road trip.

* [[2024-07-30]] 12:48  And pretty soon cable and Jesper got together to talk about it in person. I remember we had like a drink at Disneyland one time.

* [[2024-07-30]] 12:49  He is the one that attached the screen to a printed circuit board and got the software working and actually brought a game up for the first time on a prototype playdate, which still blows my mind.

* [[2024-07-30]] 12:59  We found Steven Nersesian through teenage engineering. They recommended him as somebody who could help us navigate the really complicated process of actually building playdate.

* [[2024-07-30]] 13:00  I worked with the electrical engineers and the firmware designers and the manufacturers and the executives at panic to kind of refine the specifications.
