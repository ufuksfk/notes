## Highlights
* [[2024-04-27]] 09:46  Because time ticks time with climate change and many sustainability tools for product managers are still missing.

* [[2024-04-27]] 10:06  And to me, sustainable product management is in a way that benefits our business and our planet, right.

* [[2024-04-27]] 10:14  Sustainable product management is also just good product management. Don't build things nobody needs. Right.

* [[2024-04-27]] 10:14  They are built to keep streaming high quality, expensive data, right? Because that's how they make their money. But that has a massive, massive climate impact.

* [[2024-04-27]] 10:16  You download that episode, you're on a flight, whatever, watching Netflix on your phone and two things usually happen. People are shocked at the impact of something so small and so mundane, and then people despair, right?

* [[2024-04-27]] 10:34  But we know that if you're a front end, I would say product manager, and I'm struggling to find a proper key result that could be connected to an overall sustainability objective about how we make sure that we do not contribute to technical obsolescence.

* [[2024-04-27]] 11:05  It's kind of interesting because I'm giving a training at the moment and the two assignments that I give to my fellows are one looking at the playbook and the 33 best practices in the playbook and looking at the ones they can implement without permission and the one they can implement.
