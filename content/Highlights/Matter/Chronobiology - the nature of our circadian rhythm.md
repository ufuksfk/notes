## Highlights
* [[2024-06-16]] 11:51  In this episode, we talk with Dr. Thil Ranoberg, professor emeritus at the Medical School of Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, and founder of the company Consulting. Till is currently president of the World Federation of Societies for Chronobiology and former president of the European Society for Rhythms Research. He has initiated and directed several large national and international research networks and received several international research prizes, and has been named ambassador of Sleep by the German Sleep foundation. Along his career, he has published more than 200 papers that have been cited more than 21,000 times and has written two books, internal time, published by the Harvard University Press in 2012, and the right to sleep without further introduction.

* [[2024-06-16]] 12:22  First of all, because we're day active animals. And day active animals exploit light as one of the main sources of information. Because we are visualizing the world through our eyes. We know where to go and where is what in our environment. Because we look at the world through our eyes

* [[2024-06-16]] 12:38  we have is the tidal period, which is close to 12 hours.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:16  We have a 24 hours day, because the earth takes about 24 hours to turn around itself. And the next one is the lunar environmental rhythm, which is around 28 days.

* [[2024-06-16]] 12:48  So it hasn't adapted to that, and I'm not sure whether it will adapt to it, because the state of knowing when the sun is up and when the sun is setting cannot be easily replaced by artificial light. So in other words, we have gone through an enormous change, because inside we get, in fact 1000 less light than we do outside. We are lucky to get 100 to 400 lux inside, while during a rainy day we already get over 10,000 lux. On a sunny day, outside we get 100,000 lux. So what happened is that the circadian system had great difficulties in synchronizing to the 24 hours world with such lower signal strength

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:29  And we can, to a certain extent, catch up on lost sleep. And a big study by auckersted from Sweden has shown that if you are not taking the chances to catch up on sleep during the weekend, in huge populational studies, one can show that your chances to die earlier than those who actually take advantage of sleeping in on the weekend is increased.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:31  And these people very often live a non entrained life. And let's say they have a 25 hours day that they produce.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:32  There are other people of whom we know still too little, and those are sighted people who are still not entrained.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:33  And that is a very since sleep is a very important part of being successful during wake. We are playing a dangerous game with an alarm clock.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:35  But once we get sort of above 50 or 60, there is an exponential increase in the probability of dying. It's very, very banal.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:36  So anything that you would have gotten at the age of 90, the more you live against your body clock, you're pulling it in that you are already being able to get that at the age of 80 or 70 or 60, depending on how big the strain is.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:41  We have to try and put into the ceilings of every office and every apartment, because that would take us camping.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:41  Of course, you don't notice that if you look out of the window, but if you had a diffuse light coming from the ceiling that was directly connected to the light that's coming from the roof, you would be in contact with nature and you would get a very strong signal.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:47  In Europe, you can see very clearly that the further west somebody lives within the time zone, the higher the probability of this person to become sick, the higher the probability of this person to earn less money.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:50  There is another thing which very few people know or incorporate into their arguments, and that is only morning light can make the clocks earlier. Evening light makes the clocks later.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:51  It's just the worst idea that you can have is daylight saving times. And it's remarkable how belief based and mood based people argue concerning daylight saving time, because they say something like, I like the long evenings.

* [[2024-06-16]] 09:56  So to be healthy and as happy as possible, because in winter we shouldn't be quite as happy as we are in spring and summer, but to be healthy and as happy as possible, we should do two things.
