## Highlights
* [[2024-06-01]] 20:14  Because routing one USB C pair through the whole laptop lit is much easier than routing the whole CSI interface for the laptop lit.

* [[2024-06-15]] 17:54  Because now if you do this, we have to deal with quite a bit more challenging signal integrity situation, I would say, because this flex cable for one has to be sandwiched between the aluminium tray of the lid itself, but also the display panel which also has a metal backing. So we have a pcb that sandwiched between two metal parts, meaning we can't use a two layer board.
