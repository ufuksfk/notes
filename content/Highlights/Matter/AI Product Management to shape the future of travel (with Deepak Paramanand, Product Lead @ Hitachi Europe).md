## Highlights
* [[2024-11-14]] 17:16  So that's the kind of the broad limit I have today. That's cool. And if I could put one feature request in your backlog, I think it would be to try to use the power of AI to do something with the toilets on the trains because you know, there's something that needs to be fixed.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:16  I should maybe have like a public backlog and ask people to feature requests. And some people have asked to say, why can't I have a gym in the train? Right. Why can't you tell me which carriage is full and why can't I just go and sit there like. Yeah, absolutely right.

* [[2024-11-14]] 12:46  I remember the Innovators Dilemma book by Clinton Christensen, which obviously talks a lot about the trouble that big firms have to kind of basically keep up with small, more agile, nimble firms.
