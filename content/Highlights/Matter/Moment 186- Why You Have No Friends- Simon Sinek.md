## Highlights
* [[2024-11-08]] 12:43  I’m trying to understand what friend means, and I’m trying to understand the responsibility we have to look after those friends. You look at all the longevity studies, all the blue zone work.

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:56  And so what ended up happening was it ceased to be 45. 1. We got together, and for 90 minutes we talked about me. And then the next Wednesday we got together, and for 90 minutes we talked about me. And then we got together, and for 90 minutes we talked about me. And within about three or four weeks, her life was full on, back on track. Fully back on track. Because when you help someone with a thing that you are struggling with, you actually end up solving your own problems. And so what I would say to that kid is, find somebody who's struggling to make a friend and help them make a friend. Make it an act of service. Because fundamentally, if we dig down deep, the true skill that we've lost is service.

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:53  And it was. I was. I knew what I was doing, right. There was kind of an experiment happening, which I didn't let on, which is I wanted her to help me as a way of helping herself. And so what ended up happening was it ceased to be 45. 1. We got together, and for 90 minutes we talked about me. And then the next Wednesday we got together, and for 90 minutes we talked about me. And then we got together, and for 90 minutes we talked about me. And within about three or four weeks, her life was full on, back on track. Fully back on track.

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:53  Will's friend's dad died. Will texted him and said, I feel for you. I know what you're going through. I lost my mom at an early age. I'm sure you're being inundated with calls and texts, so I'm not going to call you today. But what I will do is I will call you every Single day at 9:45am do not feel obligated to pick up. I don't mind if you don't, but when you're ready, know that I'm calling you. And for the next, I think it was three months, eight months, something. He called every single day at 9:45am and for the first week, his friend didn't pick up at all. And then after the first week, he picked up every day and they talked every day for months. Like, think about the intentionality that somebody who loves and cares about you so much that they will call you every single day at 9:45 just so that you can see their name pop up and the caller ID to know that you're not alone. I mean, it brings me to tears just thinking about it. Like, how many of us are that good a friend? You know, I want friends like that.

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:54  I have fewer friends that I can go to when things go perfectly than I would go to when things go wrong. So are those my true friends? So this is on the journey I'm on. I'm trying to understand what friend means, and I'm trying to understand the responsibility we have to look after those friends

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:54  look at all the longevity studies, all the blue zone work. Sure, they eat healthy, sure they walk a lot, but they also eat with each other. Whereas you look at some of the people who are promoting longevity and all of those biohacks and how you have to exercise the certain way and eat the certain way, you'll find a lot of them are pretty unhappy people and pretty Lonely people, I don't think they're going to live very long, right? So here's a crazy, crazy one. Here's a crazy, crazy one. Physiologically, right?

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:54  Number one, heart. Obviously, that makes perfect sense, right?

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:54  Second one, lungs. Gotta have healthy lungs to live a long time. Cardio and all the rest of it, right? Don't smoke.

* [[2024-11-08]] 18:54  I was gonna say the brain. But the thighs, thigh muscles are the. So if you have a healthy heart, healthy lungs, and healthy thighs, statistically, you're more likely to live longer. I know. I said the same thing. Thighs.
