## Highlights
* [[2024-11-14]] 08:58  But what my father and two brothers and I did is we visited that place and ATOS grants you visa, actually.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:18  I mean, usually our products that we put into the market, or assets, as we call it, they have usually a lifetime of, let's say, 40 years. Yeah. I mean, it can be a switchgear, it can be a transformer. And we have so many cases where customers are calling us, sending us plate, a technical rating plate of that asset, of that product. And then we see it's 60 years old, it's 70 years old. And then, oh, wow. And then we're like, wow, it still runs. It's still working. Yeah, but still customers have to question, okay, what to do with it, because it feels scary. It's already 60, 70 years old.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:17  Because it was different in the past. Because in the past, you know, field service engineer traveled, for example, to naming a country now to Algeria to build up the infrastructure there, Stay there for three, four, five, six months, you know, building up the infrastructure, earning a little money, of course, and then go back home. But this with the generation currently, Generation Z, they have a different meaning to life. They don't want this anymore. They want to be home in the evening.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:17  And I can't blame them. Same for myself. I have three kids. I don't want to be out for six months installing a switchgear. I also want to be home every night.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:18  We can't replace a field service engineer. They are the heart, the core and the DNA of our service organization. I mean, we always say it's a people's business, and digital will never replace that. Probably it will be an enabler, a catalyst, but it will not replace people. So tell me, what are the most common requests you receive from asset managers?

* [[2024-11-14]] 09:37  You want to know what the data says about what the situation is, what the context is for where the equipment is located, but also what kind of state it is in and what the numbers show.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:17  One aspect that came on top of this is sustainability. My personal Feeling was the last years. It was a bit of a buzzword. But now what you see all across the world is a change in legislation. So we want to get to net zero.

* [[2024-11-14]] 09:39  Yeah, it sounds fantastic. Explain that for our audience. What you usually do is in cryogenics, you deep freeze the SF6 and then you spin it, you know, you centrifuge it and then you can filter out the different phases that are inside the gas.
