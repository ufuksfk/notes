## Highlights
* [[2024-02-28]] 07:51  You will try to build your understanding what cybersecurity really cares about. You will conclude cybersecurity cares a lot about confidentiality of the data.

* [[2024-02-28]] 07:51  It is absolutely not the case in medical devices. What is much more important is availability of that medical device at all the time and equally important, integrity of the data on that medical device.

* [[2024-02-28]] 08:25  Because when I was calculating exploitability part of the risk, it came out much higher for the risk associated with exploitation on over the wire versus the one where I need to solder something to the board.
