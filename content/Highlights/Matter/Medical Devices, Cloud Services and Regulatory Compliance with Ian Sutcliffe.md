## Highlights
* [[2024-10-24]] 12:36  So when you do that simple operation of uploading an object into an s three bucket, it's behind the scenes, replicated across multiple, what we call availability zones. You can oversimplify, but consider that different data centers and each of our regions has at least three of those. So your object is replicated across three data centers immediately. That's transparent, doesn't affect performance, it doesn't affect cost, but it allows us to meet that durability slae. So it's just an example of a simple service, but operating at cloud scale, you start to get to see the difference, that kind of capability, those durability statistics you would struggle to do on premises.

* [[2024-10-24]] 12:37  So you're moving it off physical infrastructure, you're virtualizing it, you're also moving data center, you're moving into ours, not yours. Is that a big change? A lift and shift of these workloads to cloud is really just changing the environment within which it runs. You've not changed any code, no libraries, no dependencies. Even the operating system level hasn't changed. So in my view, from a technologist perspective, moving to cloud in that case is not a big change. Of course, a lot of people would disagree with me, and there's changes to the security and risk profiles, but on a whole, from a technology perspective, it's not a big change, but it's a visible change. It is very visible change in a. Way that it was not visible before right then
