## Highlights
* [[2024-12-07]] 16:04  The period spanning from the 1920s and early 1930s before he officially joined the Nazi party in 1933, the same year Heidegger joined. During the Third Reich, Smit was a prominent Nazi jurist and was even appointed as the president of the association of National Socialist German Jurists.

* [[2024-12-07]] 16:09  Others decry the dangerous mystique that draws thinkers to his work, claiming that there are no philosophical or political lessons in Schmidt, that we are not much better served by learning elsewhere in Machiavelli or Lenin or Hegel.

* [[2024-12-12]] 13:10  Democrats, not in the lowercase sense of Democrats, let's own up. I don't think Schmidt's a fan of the Democratic Party. No, no, no. In fact, sometimes it's seems like the whole book is like, written against like 20, 22 Democrats in a certain way.

* [[2024-12-12]] 13:09  But. But yeah, so he said, you know, let's just own the fact that there is no equality without the designation of a group of unequals, the circumscription of a domain of equals which is inherently exclusive, and just like, basically accept that fact, you know, and so, yeah, you can have all things that to us, and quite rightfully so, I think, look barbaric, you know, but for him, he claims that there's nothing inconsistent with, again, democratic politics in those elements of barbarism. He's not a moralist. So it seems to me he's like, you might not like what this looks like, but all I'm trying to say, if I'm Carl Schmidt. Don't cut that one out, if I'm Carl Schmidt, is that for political concepts to be effective, they must be bounded.

* [[2024-12-12]] 13:09  So I have a kind of basic question because this is the first time I've read this one thing I think he's right about. And then like a question. So like, there is this. What I kind of took away from the first couple chapters of what we read was that, like, there's a disagree. I thought the disaggregation was between democracy and justice.
