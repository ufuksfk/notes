## Highlights
* [[2024-12-08]] 00:31  Which is hard to wrap your mind around that if you're walking through a hallway where there's 100 high school girls, 33 of them is seriously considering killing themselves. And then Harvard put out a study recently that showed that 50% of all high schoolers, 50% self report being either anxious, depressed, or rather not be alive. Tell me this is not the single most important crisis facing a generation. And throw loneliness on top of that. Which throw loneliness on top of that.

* [[2024-12-08]] 00:32  The first thing that changed over the past 15 years is there has been exponential growth in isolating technologies in every industry. Okay. So if you think of it this way, you go to the grocery store, it's self checkout. You go to the Gym, everybody has AirPods in. You go to an office, even if everyone's sitting at the office, everyone's on a zoom call. Mm. It has never been easier to not look another human being in the eye in human history. I mean, you take that as a as fact that you'll go to teenagers at a birthday party and you'll walk into a room and there's 27 kids all doing this. Right. And maybe they're doing this and two people are watching, but everyone is on their phones, and it's either Tick Tock Videos or Stranger Things or some other form of social media.

* [[2024-12-08]] 00:31  So that's the first thing that happens. The second thing is more concerning. Just like any drug our threshold raises, if you dump it big enough and hard enough. And you have a whole generation who is used to such a high threshold of dopamine that all of a sudden every part of their life needs to start matching that level. So they start dating more toxic people. They start. The CDC just reported that drugs and alcohol has gone up the past year amongst college students where it's been downward for a whole generation. And they're wondering what's going on. Tell me that the dopamine dumping on these devices is not affecting their need to actually drink more, to feel something. So it affects the brain chemistry across the board.
