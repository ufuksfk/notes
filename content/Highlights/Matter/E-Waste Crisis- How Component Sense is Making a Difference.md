## Highlights
* [[2024-11-14]] 17:15  You know, our stock used to be typically 2 years old plus which meant we couldn't really sell into the top tier companies because they need less than 2 year old stock. So we were typically selling from the big guys to smaller guys that are, got slightly less high standards. But the good brokers, to me there is, there is white as Arrow, there's white as Avnet or any of those distance, they're very, very strict. And we know that because even though our stuff's traceable, we inspect it to death.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:15  But somehow in some sites in the UK for sure, and definitely across Europe, and I'm quite sure in the us, somehow the stuff's getting out of there into a container and shipped to places like Ghana. And Ghana is just one example of many. We've, we're well aware there's lots of sites in Africa, various places. We know a lot of E waste from the US goes to China. There've been so many different people have tracked devices out of the US and for some reason a lot of your E waste still heads to China.

* [[2024-11-14]] 16:27  And they were telling us that roughly 20% would work. So they would put them in their shop and resell them the balance.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:14  And what's encouraging about the PCB recycling is that if there is an incentive there, the people are very focused. You know, you don't see circuit boards lying around like you did five years ago because there is now a value on them.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:14  So the government's got a system in place now. The Ghanaian government's put a system in place to encourage people to bring it to the recycling point. But there's more effective, more efficient ways of doing it. They tend to be selling to private companies.

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:14  Apparently a lot of it ends up back in China. We haven't managed to prove that yet, but apparently a lot of the circuit boards end up back in China

* [[2024-11-14]] 17:14  if anyone is interested in getting in touch with some of those charities that you mentioned, they should check out the show notes and we'll see about getting people in touch with some of those, those groups.
