## Highlights
* [[2024-02-22]] 07:37  And we're seeing new actors enter the space here, whether it's your googles of the world who are doing breast cancer detection, which was unthinkable to us ten years ago, that somebody outside the medical space would be getting into our work, or even places like where I work, academic hospitals, how is that changing the field?

* [[2024-02-22]] 07:41  What are all the different functions and how is it architected so that we can isolate the riskier portions of the software from the less risky portions of the software.

* [[2024-02-22]] 07:49  And more recently, with AIML, there's even a new standard that applies 14, nine, seven, one to AIML, and that's 34971. So it just has a list of potential things to think about when you're designing your software and when people come.

* [[2024-02-22]] 07:50  How can it break? How can I make sure that it can fail safely? If it's going to fail, what are the hazards in that scenario, in that clinical workflow that my software or my product might run into that could cause it to not perform properly.
