## Highlights
* [[2024-10-11]] 13:07  It's one of the many regulations places, an existing machinery directive, it will apply from January 2027, and it regulates the manufacturer, placing the market, commissioning of machines, basically, and the first time specifically artificial intelligence.

* [[2024-10-11]] 12:35  According these new technologies, the machinery directive right now has to be fulfilled within the European Union, the so called after states, and we also have agreements. We have contracts with Switzerland, the Turkey, and right now the UK.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:06  Well, to say in the first place, it's now called a regulation beforehand or right now it is a directive. So what's the difference between them? The regulation does not have to be, I would say, transformed into national law. So this is like, okay, the directive only addresses the member states and the member states have to put them into national law. So this is not necessary with the regulation. That's the first thing. And what's inside the regulation we have, well, we have smaller things like some changed or new definitions, which very interesting definition, just to have an example, is the safety component. Beforehand it was more a component as we think of it, a physical thing which you can touch, but right now it's called, it means a physical or a digital component, including software of a product within the scope. So plus it has to fulfill a safety function. It's all about safety.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:06  The whole directive is about the safety aspect. So if it's just for the process and the process is not hazardous, then it's not a problem. But if it's going into the safety, then you have to take a closer look

* [[2024-10-11]] 12:38  So one big thing is, okay, right now it can be software, which is in the regulation.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:06  beforehand it was placing on the market, but now it's making available on the market, which changes quite a lot. So the placing on the market means the first making available, but it can be the supply of a product, the distribution, which brings us to the economic operators.

* [[2024-10-11]] 12:39  We have autonomous mobile machinery, which I think is not really necessary to include it in the directive, but anyhow, and we also have the human machine collaboration. We know that from human robot collaboration, for example, which is now included in the directive.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:09  And they even updated the guideline of the actual directive so you can already deliver digital documentation if you take a look at the instructions for use. And then the customer can still print it out if they want to, I guess. Right, right

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:05  What is the difference between safety and security? Okay, let me think of it. I just recently heard a very good definition, which I like, I'm trying to translate it into English is safety is you're trying to find measures that the machine does not hurt you or a person. And security is you find measures that the human does not hurt the machine.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:08  So whatever has happened over the last 20 years, and maybe just that, they now concentrate also in addition on software, is that the big, maybe the big thing, the importance of the relative share of what makes machinery. In the end, 20 years ago it was maybe close to 100% hardware and a little bit of software, a couple of percentage points. And these days the value of the machinery is whatever, but a lot higher percentage software in relation to hardware as well. I think. Yeah, you're right. I think there are two things according software. One thing is we already have a standard for software coding, safety aspects, functional safety, which is en ISO 3849.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:08  So, and I think the reason why they put it into the regulation is, okay, everyone has to fulfill the regulation.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:08  Standards are not mandatory in the first place. You should, you should apply them, especially if they are harmonized. So it's indirectly mandatory, but not directly. So, but if you have written down the regulation, then it's definitely, definitely has to be fulfilled. So I think that's a reason.

* [[2024-10-11]] 12:49  So this regulation applies to machinery and the following related products. So this is pretty much the same.

* [[2024-10-11]] 12:51  There is a separate regulation for low voltage of other pieces that are not then included in the machinery. Right?

* [[2024-10-17]] 14:55  Exactly. So machinery directive right now also includes the goals, the targets of also of low voltage directives. So this is why if you normally, if you, if you apply machine directive, you also hit the goals of low voltage directive. But there are some assumptions like I don't know, a washing machine for example, they fall under the scope of low voltage directive because not the mechanical parts like the machinery parts are that hazardous, but more or less the voltage. We will be talking about AI, specifically software towards artificial intelligence

* [[2024-10-11]] 12:54  But using machine learning approaches, the next thing is machinery that has embedded systems with fully or partially self evolving behavior using machine learning learning approaches, ensuring safety functions that have not been placed independently on the market and respect only of those systems.

* [[2024-10-11]] 13:08  Yeah, we're not going to go into the details of that, but I think an important message is that you, the listener, may need to look into the AI act as well as into the machinery regulation. Actually, if we're talking about CE marking, it's not just the marking, it's the conformity assessment process. So if you assess the conformity, then you have to take a look at every right now, most of them are directives, but also regulations that require CE marking. And you have to take a look at all of these. And maybe you build a machine, or maybe you're just doing some software, but it can be that you fall within the scope of more than just one directive or regulation, and you have to fulfill all of them.
