## Highlights

* [[2024-09-27]] 08:29  One thing that stood out to me in that kind of section of the playbook where you go through the challenges of hardware is just you have this great series of charts, and you walk through comparing hardware startups or hardware companies to software companies, and you talk about the median gross margin, and it’s like 10% for hardware, 70% for software, time to exit, ten or eleven years for hardware, like six for software.
