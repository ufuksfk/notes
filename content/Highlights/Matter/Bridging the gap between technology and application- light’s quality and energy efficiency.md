## Highlights
* [[2024-03-16]] 14:29  I've been going to trade shows lighting for forever, but it was about 1314 years ago that I would go to trade shows, and they were introducing LEDs, and I said, yeah, that's really cool, but are you aware that it flickers?

* [[2024-03-16]] 15:41  So these are places where people are mostly in wheelchairs, they often suffer from dementia. Is there something in the lighting system that we can do to make a difference.

* [[2024-03-16]] 15:50  As soon as we reduced the light levels and warmed up, the light took out the melanopic content, the sleeping improved and the quality of sleep and the number of sleep disturbances went down.

* [[2024-03-16]] 19:44  Some people are so uneducated about lighting that they associate glare with having enough light so they may look at an office space, and if they don't see the glare from the fixtures overhead, they don't think there's enough lighting. One of the articles that you have published is about the effect of tuned lighting on nursing center resident sleep versus static lighting.

* [[2024-03-16]] 19:50  In fact, that was something that staff of the nursing home had already recognized. They knew that lighting made a huge difference in people's attitudes, in their agitation, in their health, if they could get people outdoors.

* [[2024-03-16]] 19:51  So there's a clear mandate that if you possibly can get people outdoors, because it's the perfect spectrum at the perfect time, perfect amount of light. If you can't get them outdoors, then at least get them next to windows, especially windows that are bright.

* [[2024-03-16]] 19:53  And those are the rooms that are getting southeast light. It's the morning light and it's the higher intensity of light in the northern hemisphere.

* [[2024-03-21]] 08:18  We don't need these fancy lighting systems if we have good quality daylight inside buildings. We don't need fancy lighting systems if we're stuck.
