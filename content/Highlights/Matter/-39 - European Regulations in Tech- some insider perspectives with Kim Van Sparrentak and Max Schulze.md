## Highlights
* [[2024-05-25]] 19:38  She's a member of the Green Party, and she has been involved on pretty much all legislation related to tech and sustainability in these last five years.

* [[2024-05-25]] 19:43  And I think one of the things that is, I think the most important thing to know before we can really dive into the legislation per se, is that we actually don't fully grasp what the environmental impact of technology is right now, because all these tech companies are very fake about how much energy they actually use. They are claiming their sustainment. I mean, Amazon lobbyists have told me they're the most sustainable company in the world.

* [[2024-05-25]] 19:44  Like, we might know that Google uses this many kilowatt hours of energy, but how much is in one YouTube video, we don't know. Right. How much is in an Instagram picture? We don't know.

* [[2024-05-25]] 19:52  That's how much power they consume. But how much of their revenue is that in cost? And it's about 4%.

* [[2024-05-25]] 19:55  Do we need all these things that can generate videos for some reason, while we know that that uses lots of energy and can be used in a dangerous way when it comes to our democracies, for example, we need that discussion, and it's very difficult to start a discussion from top down.

* [[2024-05-25]] 19:58  And the truth is, in today's society, technology is not a tool.

* [[2024-05-25]] 20:00  And this is, of course, a very smart business model, but it's not a business model that's going to get us anywhere, us having to buy a new phone every two, three years when we're lucky.

* [[2024-05-25]] 20:02  And then all of a sudden a very functional switch that's like maybe three years old needs to be replaced because somebody said, ah, you know, this switch, it's like three years old, we're not going to support it anymore.

* [[2024-05-25]] 20:06  Let's say we force Google to reduce the energy consumption per search by 10%. Let's say we do that. How are you going to check? Because every time you ask them, can I see it?

* [[2024-05-25]] 20:44  And unfortunately, in the current version, most of the facts that I need are not public. Again, they have managed to make it only visible to the commission, which is progress, but they're not public.
