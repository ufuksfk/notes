## Highlights
* [[2024-12-03]] 10:42  Robot taxes were in vogue, at least discussed five years ago. Could we have AI taxes to make them less attractive as a replacement for humans? It makes humans comparatively cheaper. There are a number of issues there. So let me take them up one by one. First of all, anytime you're talking about slowing down technological change, you have to be very careful. Our political track record of blocking technological change is not good, to say the least.

* [[2024-12-03]] 10:43  An open letter signed by Elon Musk is calling for a pause on the. Development of more powerful artificial intelligence systems. Citing risks to society. That's why I was one of the early signatories of the call for halting the training of large language models for six months until new understanding regulatory framework is developed. Developers working on systems more powerful than OpenAI's newly launched GPT4 to pause their work for six months to make time for safely.

* [[2024-12-04]] 00:07  I love technological progress. There's nothing more that I enjoy and cherish than science. But AI is going too fast and it's on a wrong path. And we just don't have the regulatory framework or understanding of where it's going to be able to respond to it. So that was worries me.

* [[2024-12-03]] 10:43  Struck a lot of people that I spoke to in a technology business as not remotely practical. No one's going to stop. They're too enthusiastic. I know, but we need to develop the alternative perspective. I knew that they wouldn't stop it for six months, but just building that broad coalition and I don't think stopping it is the right solution.

* [[2024-12-03]] 10:42  The uk, US and many other countries tax code already excessively subsidizes capital and digital capital at the expense of labor. We impose income taxes, payroll taxes and lots of other taxes on companies, directly or indirectly via their workers. If they hire more employees, we subsidize them. When they adopt capital, they're often adopting that capital to replace the workers. So we're subsidizing automation. So why not level the playing field and equate the marginal taxes on capital and labor?

* [[2024-12-03]] 10:42  it work as well to break up Big Tech? I do think so. I do not think that it's a holistic solution. I don't think it would be enough by itself. But yes, I think it would be a good idea because these are the largest corporations we have seen in humanity's history. Yeah. And they are very powerful, both politically and socially. Leave alone the economic power, they just set the agenda.
