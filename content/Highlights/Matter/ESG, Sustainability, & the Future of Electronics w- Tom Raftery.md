## Highlights
* [[2024-03-11]] 08:01  He is an independent technology and sustainability consultant. He's also host of the climate confident podcast and the sustainable supply chain podcast.

* [[2024-03-11]] 08:09  So I pretty confidently predict that that'll happen. There'll be anti greenwashing legislation in other GeOs as well.

* [[2024-03-11]] 17:38  The data they will be reporting will be increasingly accurate and auditable. A lot of it comes from the likes of sensors, and if it's sensor related data right there, you can see where the data is coming from and you can test it, and that's right there.

* [[2024-03-11]] 17:40  And they have a platform which allows thousands of sensors per square meter, and it's a peer to peer networking system, and it manages to transmit data without any collisions.

* [[2024-03-11]] 17:45  But the 55% goal is against the 1990 baseline. And now, since 1990, the EU has actually reduced its emissions 24%.

* [[2024-03-11]] 17:46  Now. In 2020, when we shut down the global economy, the emissions in the EU dropped 7%.

* [[2024-03-11]] 17:52  That kind of penalty would be unheard of here. Well, not really. The GDPR is similar.

* [[2024-03-11]] 17:55  And this is legislation that's coming in as well, which requires manufacturers of electric vehicles to be able to show where the materials in batteries were mined and how they were mined, the carbon footprint of them, whether there was forced labor, et cetera.

* [[2024-03-11]] 20:25  And she said, look, Tom, yes, it does raise the cost of the vehicle, about roughly $3 per vehicle.
