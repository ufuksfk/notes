## Highlights
* [[2024-03-13]] 07:28  But I have a set of really great light advisors who help me a lot. They are basically volunteers, but they're experts within the lighting industry.

* [[2024-06-30]] 13:40  Wells aim is really simple. It's to make sure as many people as possible around the world spend their time in healthy interiors and healthy spaces. We do this by focusing on research, seeing what's true through validated research and translating that into well requirements and making as much impact as possible.

* [[2024-06-30]] 13:41  And because the standard was written in New York, the main demographic that was taken into consideration was office workers in the US.

* [[2024-06-30]] 13:42  Then it expanded when we released in 2014 to different space types. We started seeing interest from retail areas, from schools, homes. And then we started looking at how we can develop well to encompass these spaces and these special projects. On top of that, we started seeing a lot of countries looking at, well, seeing how we can bring together the best practices and needs of those different regions and projects

* [[2024-03-13]] 07:32  We currently have an advisory for airports. We just closed an advisory for sports venues. And we're learning from these experts and seeing what is needed in those space types, and we are integrating that into the rating system.

* [[2024-03-13]] 07:34  The first is to provide a visually comfortable environment, and the second is to maintain day night circadian rhythm through light exposure.

* [[2024-03-13]] 07:41  Some of the main changes in that feature set include more options for daylight exposure, more clarity on the lighting control feature. We allow for more options on the visual balance feature to allow creative lighting design while still maintaining a visually comfortable environment.

* [[2024-03-13]] 07:41  Including light at night, making sure that there is little light or enough light for people to sleep.

* [[2024-03-13]] 07:50  Change when it comes to daylight. And this is not only in wealth but also in all other green building certifications.

* [[2024-03-13]] 17:24  And we've also noticed that one of the challenges when implementing some of the features in real projects still connected to circadian light is the placement of fixtures with regards to the internal layout of regular occupied spaces, because it's crucial to know where people are going to sit and what a standard day of work looks like. Otherwise there is a risk for over lighting the space, which can increase energy consumption.
