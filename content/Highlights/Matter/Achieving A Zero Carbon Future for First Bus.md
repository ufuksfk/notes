## Highlights
* [[2024-11-25]] 11:28  You don't have that joy with electricity because the buses all come home typically in the early evening when we're all going to go and have our dinner and the price is about a year high. So what we're trying to do is push it into the night as much as we can without tripping over them not being ready in the morning. So another thing we're kind of measuring our success on really is kind of how much are we enabling them to save money compared to what would have happened if we simply weren't there. That's really interesting.

* [[2024-11-25]] 11:28  And as we record this, I think it's just been announced in the news this week, our final coal plant in the UK is going to close through September. So we're firmly on that journey to actually being able to supply our own sort of renewable energy. I mean, there's obviously a lot of it happening already, but. So the UK is in a great position in that respect.
