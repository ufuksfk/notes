## Highlights
* [[2024-07-16]] 15:00  But anyway, itâ€™s quite possible that the very strong automotive design activity of the last four or five years is slowing down somewhat, and that companies have what they need in terms of printed circuit board design.

* [[2024-07-18]] 10:27  The PCB design tool sales are still in the black on a year over year basis, up more than 45 million. But the growth rate slowed a bit and the market was down sequentially for the second straight quarter. What can you tell us? Well, I can tell you that for total electronic design automation, it was a great continuation at 14.4%. Excellent growth overall, right in line with the four quarter moving average.

* [[2024-07-18]] 10:28  Geographically, it looks like Asia is closing the gap with the Americas. It's just about $200 million lower and about five percentage points behind in terms of market share. So should the Americas be worried? Well, you have to decide where is design being done? Where are they using the software?
