## Highlights
* [[2024-01-21]] 14:10  The most recent flagship Bluetooth version is Bluetooth 5.0, which, according to the latest Mobile Overview Report from ScientiaMobile, has penetrated 91% of the combined Android and iOS markets in the U.S. as of Q1 2023.

* [[2024-01-21]] 14:14  As a consequence of not allowing the peripheral device to wake the central device, connected medical device system manufacturers must contend with the differences between foreground and background processing.

* [[2024-01-21]] 14:15  As mentioned above, when an app is in background mode, its companion hardware cannot use BLE to wake it up. Therefore, medical device manufacturers must program scheduled wakeups into the software itself to perform necessary tasks (e.g., a CGM app that wakes up every two minutes to retrieve data from the CGM device peripheral).
