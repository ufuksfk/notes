## Highlights
* [[2024-03-11]] 21:03  And so it kind of works out nicely. I focused over a decade of my career in manufacturing, and it worked at the Mitsubishi Silicon America, worked at Freightliner, worked in agriculture, manufacturing, building these big one ton bales and one ton bale machines, lots of automation, lots of robotics in integration of equipment.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:23  So that's where they hire someone like me to come in and automate the data collection using electronic interfaces. But those protocols are just so different in every piece of equipment.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:24  So the thing that stopped manufacturing is this proprietary protocols and the expense of getting the data out of them. So that's been my mission for the last almost 40 years of, can we just plug?

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:25  A few protocols, though, I think have finally achieved the reality. And there's OPC. OPC UA is a new protocol, and that one is picking up steam, but it is really complicated.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:26  This push technology is a really important concept where when a piece of equipment says I've got some data to share, it just pushes it out there. A lot of other protocols, including OPC, UA is a polling technology.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:27  You can get free ones, you can get brokers from vendors like Farcom has a mission critical MQTT broker built into our IoT platform, because the open source ones really aren't for mission critical use cases.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:28  It's a nightmare. Json, you just look at it, and anyone can read it. Every single human on the planet can look at that and go, oh, there's a tag that says temperature, there's a value that says 21.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:34  So equipment that starts to go out of range, it starts to perform more poorly, often consumes more energy. So it's also good to tell you when your equipment is going bad.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:46  There's an airbag company that went out of business because of that a few years ago, and I actually worked with their competitor to implement this very thing to make them more sustainable and stay in business.

* [[2024-03-11]] 21:50  They figure out, they train the models, they bring it back and run it on their IoT platform. And they are using vibrations to now detect equipment failure and fix the machines before they create defective products.
