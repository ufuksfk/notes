I took that course at the beginning of [[2024]]. notes are not organized. A course from [[Medical Device HQ]]

In USA, we have [[21 CFR 820]], in EU we have [[(MDR) Medical Device Regulation of EU]]

PMA 510(k) and Device listing. PMA is most expensive and time consuming option

Audit performed by external client should be referred as second party audit

CE-marked medical device in EU needs a QMS and Technical documentation
![[Pasted image 20250114154609.png|500]]
diagnosis therapy surgery or birth control. achieves primary purpose not by pharmacological metabolic or immunological

combination products: medical product with medicinal product
The legal manufacture is responsible for describing intended use of a product. [[Intended Use of Medical Device]]

# Medical Device Terminology

[[(QMS) Quality Management System]]: QMS, All manufacturers should have QSR and [[ISO 13485]], can be paper or digital

[[Quality of Medical Device]]: about fullfilling requirements, not only product but also system must be quality

[[Legal Manufacturer of Medical Device]]: responsible of design and manufacturer. They can outsource real manufacturing but whoever has design and qms is legal manufacturer

[[Authorized Representative of Medical Device]]: a person in EU for MDR, US FDA agent for USA scenario

![[Pasted image 20250114154955.png|500]]
[[(MDR) Medical Device Regulation of EU]] is focused but we also have [[IVDR]]
![[Pasted image 20250114155034.png|500]]

# Standards
Without standards, you should reinvent wheel.
![[Pasted image 20250114155129.png|500]]
there is product standarts and process standarts [[Product Standards vs Process Standards]]
[[ISO 13485]] is QMS. Applied to medical device manufacturers depending on classification
[[ISO 14971]] for risk management for medical devices. It shall cover all the lifetime of product.
[[IEC 62366]]-1 human factors engineering close relationship with [[ISO 14971]]
[[ISO 10933]]-1 biocompatibility. It applies to all contact with people. It is not applicaple to SW.
[[IEC 60601]]-1 safety and essential performance for medical electrical equipment
[[IEC 62304]] for software life cycle process

# Introduction to Audits
audit will find you ðŸ™‚
if audit goes wrong, you can lose the right to manufacture
competent authorities = fda
Medical products agency in SE
Every country have compenent
[[Notified Bodies of MDR]] do visiting while FDA do it by themselves
![[Pasted image 20250114155435.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20250114155454.png|500]]

Desktop audit -> "Procedure vs Standard"
On-site audit -> "Practice vs procedures"

It can take up to 10 days
* 1st party audits = means do it yourself, internal audits
* 2nd party audits = external provider audit,
* 3rd party audit = accredited audit
![[Pasted image 20250114155611.png|500]]
# Quality concepts and audits
Question areas from auditors:
* Quality in general
	* Quality policy
	* Quality objectives
* your position / role
	* Responsibilities and authorities
* Observing work
	* How you carry out your work
	* What are the things you are using
	* Records
[[Quality Policy of Medical Device]]
![[Pasted image 20250114155822.png|400]]
![[Pasted image 20250114155901.png|600]]
![[Pasted image 20250114155916.png|600]]

## what is non-conformity
![[Pasted image 20250114155958.png|300]]

## unannounced audits
it is sth in eu
every 3 to 5 years, they can come. notified bodies
if they come, verify that they are notified body
they should carry id card to prove that

[[Complaint of Medical Device]]:
![[Pasted image 20250114160054.png|500]]
if they ask something irrelevant like why it is too heavy. then you can explain why but do nothing as it has nothing to do for regulations
written, electronics or oral that alleges deficiencies about identity, quality, durability, reliability, usability, safety or performance
they can say I am happy but it can be better
regulatory time limits if someone injured.

# Product development
pharma industry focus on manufacturing while medical focus on design
planning first= what when and who and how much?
execution
you should include intended use to planning

![[Pasted image 20250114160158.png|400]]
[[Design Review of Medical Device]] focused on quality and quality only
[[Design Output of Medical Device]]
risk management of product. not project
design transfer
[[(DMR) Device Master Record of Medical Device]]
then Design Verification
![[Pasted image 20250114160525.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250114160325.png]]

[[Validation of Medical Device]]  means to check if it is really working and useful

# [[(GSPR) General Safety Performance Requirements]]
you have a checklist like that:
![[Pasted image 20250114160447.png]]

# Product Documentation
[[(DHF) Design History File of Medical Device]]: rather to show what is done historically
	important collection of documents to auditor
[[(DMR) Device Master Record of Medical Device]]
	How to produce the device. Shall be readily accessible. An index is usually needed due to the amount of document
[[(DHR) Device History Record of Medical Device]]
	Contains or references the records necessary to demonstrate that device is manufactured in accordance with the approved device master record and the req of this part

# [[Risk Management of Medical Device]]
for product safety, not project or company
mentioned in 14 places in [[ISO 13485]]
Areas that require risk management:
* Software and proces validation
* Verification off effectiveness of training
* Product development
* Production
* Change control
* Purchasing
* Verification of purchased products
* Post-market surveillance
* Clinical investigations

[[Safety of Medical Device]] is freedom from unacceptable risk

[[Hazar Traceability Matrix of Medical Device]]
![[Pasted image 20250114160916.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250114160932.png]]

[[Risk of Medical Device]] according to [[ISO 14971]]:
	Combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.
money or being late in project is business risk, not medical device risk :)
Risk Control options:
* Inherent safety by design and manufacture (most effective)
* Protective measures in the medical device itself or in the manufacturing process (automated tests)
* Information for safety, and training to users (user experience)
[[Safety of Medical Device]] means what is generally accepted. State of the art.

# Usability Engineering
[[IEC 62366]]
it also means human factor engineering at fda
regulatory point of view, it only relates to safety. user friendly is not a topic of regulation
good usability sometimes need less user-friendly
user interface is not only screen, but also label papers and everything user can interact
![[Pasted image 20250114161245.png]]
## [[Formative Evaluation of Medical Device]]
formative evaluation means same thing as in teaching
this quizzes are also formative evaluation
any survey to understand how user use your device

## [[Summative Evaluation of Medical Device]]
summative evaluation is not the same as design validation
design validation is for user needs are met, while summative evaluation checks user interface is safe

# Production and Infrastructure
keep things clean and sterile
production and prototype should be in different rooms, prototype should be clearly marked as prototype
how to get into production and how to behave there
esd can also injure components
a lot of devices are invasive
sterilization is made by radiation or etylene oxide
sterile means packaged after sterilization
tyvek pouch is perfect material for packaging
dont touch your face
avoid farting ðŸ™‚

keeping sterile and nonsterile product in seperateplace is regulated by [[ISO 13485]]

# Product Approval

## under [[(MDR) Medical Device Regulation of EU]]
you need to CE mark for sure
QMS is surely needed [[ISO 13485]]
annex 1 of mdr as GSPR
technical documentation, annex 2 of mdr
notified body
clinical evaluation and investigation
[[Clinical Evaluation of Medical Device]] vs [[Clinical Investigation of Medical Device]]
![[Pasted image 20250114161555.png|500]]
## under [[FDA]]

[[21 CFR 820]] for QMS
[[(DHR) Device History Record of Medical Device]], [[(DMR) Device Master Record of Medical Device]] [[Clinical Trial of Medical Device]] and FDA submission and inspection
Device listing is a route to us market
510(k) / pre market notification
Pre market approval
510(k) gives not approval but clearance

# post market surveillance
monitor to safety
requirement for all in EU and most of the device in US
![[Pasted image 20250114161752.png|300]]
Post market clinical follow-up PMCF focuse more on clinical situation
periodic safety update reports PSUR
