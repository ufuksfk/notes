## Active Transducers
* Magnetic Induction Transducer
	* IOP sensor as an example to monitor the movement of the eye.
* Piezoelectric Transducer
	* Sonar, acoustic
	* Most used and most famous one in medical
	* Crystal microphones
* Photovoltaic Transducer
	* ion concentration mesaurement, hearbeat sensors from fingers
* Thermoelectric Transducer
	* operate based on the Seebeck effect
	* voltage is generated because of temperature difference at thermocouple
## Passive Transducers
* Resistive
	* Strain Gauge
* Capacitive
	* measures change in displacement
	* touch screens
	* weight measurement
	* body motion detection
* Inductive
