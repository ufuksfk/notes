## Page Notes
Key Takeaways from the Webpage:

Sustainability is an approach to design and development that focuses on environmental, social, and financial factors, and it promotes reducing waste, decreasing carbon footprint, and promoting diversity and decentralization.
Digital products have an impact on the physical environment through transportation, travel, printing, and delivery processes. It is important to consider how these products affect the environment.
Companies can design for sustainability by making small-effort improvements that can have a positive social and environmental impact, as well as improve user experience and sales.

eBay can encourage users to sell their old items and use ground shipping instead of air shipping to make a positive impact on the environment.

## Highlights
- [[2023-11-21]] 10:56 97% of households in the UK own an electric tea kettle and 65% of them admit to overfilling their kettles. The extra energy that is wasted on a daily basis for boiling unused water is enough to light all the streetlights in London for a night. — [original](https://hyp.is/PgA4gIhUEe6qmtPqFVgZuA/uxdesign.cc/product-design-for-sustainability-3fffbb2a7f0e)


- [[2023-11-21]] 11:02 macOS should automatically downscale content of documents that are having a single paragraph on the last page. — [original](https://hyp.is/A8Sk_IhVEe6qNjczJsVlHg/uxdesign.cc/product-design-for-sustainability-3fffbb2a7f0e)
    -   #sustainable  #product 
    - good idea

Chrome doesn’t even have a scale-down option. It does have a “Minimize margins” option, but 
Google
 took a product decision to hide it behind two additional clicks in the “More Settings” section.

Bad for google


- [[2023-11-21]] 11:03 Direct flights are much less harmful to the environment. A sustainability factor could be used as a selling point for direct (more expensive) flights, so Kayak can get a bigger cut. — [original](https://hyp.is/Rb66oIhVEe6rqb85qf8Wbg/uxdesign.cc/product-design-for-sustainability-3fffbb2a7f0e)

- [[2023-11-21]] 11:05 Promote public transportation over car by showing it as the first tab in the right context. For me taking driving to the office with a car takes almost the same time as going by bus. I never drive a car and Google knows it. I don’t even have a driver licence, but Google still decides to promote private cars over other transportation options for me. — [original](https://hyp.is/elhrxohVEe6TYEeFZ3RBWg/uxdesign.cc/product-design-for-sustainability-3fffbb2a7f0e)
