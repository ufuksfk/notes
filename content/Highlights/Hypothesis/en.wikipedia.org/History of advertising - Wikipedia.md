- [[2023-12-04]] 14:30 Modern advertising began to take shape with the advent of newspapers and magazines in the 16th and 17th centuries. The very first weekly gazettes appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland.[18] In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and that country's first daily newspaper, The Daily Courant, was published from 1702 to 1735.[19] Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising which contributed to the cost of printing and distribution.[20] The earliest commercial advertisements promoted books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.[21] â€” [original](https://hyp.is/RaEOypKpEe6vtWsd5_Wh-Q/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_advertising)
