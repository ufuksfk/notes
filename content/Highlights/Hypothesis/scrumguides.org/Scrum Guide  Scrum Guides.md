## Highlights
- [[2023-11-28]] 15:09 Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions. — [original](https://hyp.is/vMMxLo33Ee6JnNdTGShKog/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)


- [[2023-11-28]] 15:14 Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials. — [original](https://hyp.is/aGJ-GI34Ee6ggJvboks3dQ/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)


- [[2023-11-28]] 15:17 Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. — [original](https://hyp.is/2Ka86I34Ee65qUOugCUZsw/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)


- [[2023-11-28]] 15:18 Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful. — [original](https://hyp.is/_GKyQI34Ee6H4otAi5LUFw/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)


- [[2023-11-28]] 15:18 Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change. — [original](https://hyp.is/_qzM6I34Ee6RMfNH-as0wA/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)


- [[2023-11-28]] 15:21 If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner. — [original](https://hyp.is/d712oI35Ee6mksdrdTMs0w/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

- [[2023-11-28]] 15:27 During the Sprint: No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal; Quality does not decrease; The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and, Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned. — [original](https://hyp.is/QwmF7I36Ee6KDLeTAhewsA/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)


- [[2023-11-28]] 15:31 Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. — [original](https://hyp.is/2_k72o36Ee6yw6fxxd_5ag/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)


- [[2023-11-28]] 15:42 Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done. — [original](https://hyp.is/YgZc6I38Ee6JrRviWCd4xg/scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)
