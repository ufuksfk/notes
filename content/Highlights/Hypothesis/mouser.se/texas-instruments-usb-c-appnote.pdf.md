## Highlights
- [[2024-03-28]] 11:44 Strictly, ‘USB-C’ relates to the mechanical design of the connector as data communications arestipulated in USB 3.x and USB 4.0 standards, as well as protocols such as Thunderbolt. The USB-Cconnector is 60% smaller than earlier USB A connectors and, despite this size it contains moreconductors as well as having higher voltage and current ratings and improved bandwidth — [original](https://hyp.is/FvEnnuzwEe6_xUeWOEed3Q/www.mouser.se/pdfDocs/texas-instruments-usb-c-appnote.pdf)


- [[2024-03-28]] 11:45 Furthermore, theconnectors have been tested up to 10,000 insertions which is significantly more durable than a USB Aconnector. With this level of durability, cables can be used for longer, dramatically reducing thenumber sent to landfill. — [original](https://hyp.is/RWiJ5uzwEe6Zz9_QbHGV3g/www.mouser.se/pdfDocs/texas-instruments-usb-c-appnote.pdf)


- [[2024-03-28]] 11:45 In 2021, revision 3.1 was announced1increasing the available power from 100W to 240W. At the same time, new voltages of 28V, 36V and48V were announced, adding to the 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V that were available in earlier versions — [original](https://hyp.is/U6pOwuzwEe66528-YOK84A/www.mouser.se/pdfDocs/texas-instruments-usb-c-appnote.pdf)


- [[2024-03-28]] 11:46 Another key change with this revision was making the power transfer bi-directional, so that energycan be shared within a USB system to satisfy short-term peak demands. An example of this is adevice that receives power from a USB hub returning power to the hub while an HDD is drawingsignificant power as it spins up. — [original](https://hyp.is/bpYxVuzwEe6imUsMmyAE6g/www.mouser.se/pdfDocs/texas-instruments-usb-c-appnote.pdf)
