- [[2023-10-19]] 09:01 Two main considerations determine how much capacitance you will need: the required holdup time and the allowable ripple voltage. — [original](https://hyp.is/WBT3VG5NEe68oV-Ajcmuwg/e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/powerhouse/posts/predicting-output-capacitor-ripple-in-a-ccm-boost-pfc-circuit)

    - bulk cap selection to PFC

- [[2023-10-19]] 09:04 Both low- and high-frequency ripple currents are not functions of the amount of capacitance. Low-frequency current is a function of the output power; it is not a function of line voltage. High-frequency ripple is greatest at low line and is a function of line, boost inductance and output power. — [original](https://hyp.is/tKxkZm5NEe6IT9NzLh1_kw/e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/powerhouse/posts/predicting-output-capacitor-ripple-in-a-ccm-boost-pfc-circuit)
    - low freq and high freq ripple currents of the output bulk is depending on:
