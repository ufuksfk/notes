- [[2023-09-27]] 10:49 With typical slewrates around 30 V/ns to 100 V/ns at operating voltages around 380 V to 480 V, printed circuit board (PCB)layout optimization is even more essential since parasitic inductances and capacitances from poor layoutscan drastically reduce performance or even prevent operation — [original](https://hyp.is/tVzj5l0SEe6_HNeMgCKnAg/www.ti.com/lit/an/snoa946a/snoa946a.pdf?ts=1695718032326)


- [[2023-09-27]] 10:50 The LMG3410x devices have a user-controllable slew rate from 30 V/nsto 100 V/ns. While this helps reduce the power loss during each switching transition, it also increases thevoltage and current slew rates. As Equation 1 shows, by increasing the current slew rate the voltageinduced across any parasitic inductor is increased, increasing voltage overshoot on the power device. — [original](https://hyp.is/69j25F0SEe6vaDvAGUyhyQ/www.ti.com/lit/an/snoa946a/snoa946a.pdf?ts=1695718032326)
