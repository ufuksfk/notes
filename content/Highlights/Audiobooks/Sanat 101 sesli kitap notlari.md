# [[Frida Kahlo]]
Frida Kahlo was a renowned Mexican artist known for her symbolic and vibrant self-portraits. Born in Mexico City, she faced numerous challenges throughout her life, including polio as a child and a bus accident in her teens that left her with chronic pain. These hardships deeply influenced her artwork, which often conveyed pain, suffering, and resilience. Frida was deeply involved in Mexican political and social issues and was married to another famous artist, Diego Rivera. Though she gained some recognition in her lifetime, it was posthumously that her work garnered international acclaim, making her a global icon of feminism, art, and Mexican culture.

# [[Louvre Museum]]
The Louvre, located in Paris, originally began its life as a historic fortress in the late 12th century under [[Philip II of France]] Over the centuries, it underwent numerous transformations, evolving from a fortress to a royal residence. It suffered multiple damages, being destroyed and rebuilt several times due to wars and renovations. During the [[French Revolution]], the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces. As time progressed, the palace increasingly dedicated itself to the arts, amassing one of the most extensive art collections in the world. At a certain point in its history, its royal residency ceased, and it transitioned fully to its role as an art museum. Its galleries display thousands of works of art, including the world-famous '[[Mona Lisa]]' and [[Venus de Milo]]. Today, the Louvre is not only a testament to France's rich history but is also recognized as one of the world's most renowned and visited museums.

# [[Light colors vs Painting Colors]]
Painting Colors vs. Light Colors:
1. **Origin**:
    - **Painting Colors**: Made by pigments. When white light hits them, they absorb certain wavelengths and reflect others.
    - **Light Colors**: Produced by light sources like screens or bulbs. Colors are a result of different wavelengths of light emitted.
2. **Mixing**:
    - **Painting (Subtractive Mixing)**: Mixing primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) removes wavelengths. Mixing all gives black.
    - **Light (Additive Mixing)**: Mixing primary colors (red, green, blue) adds wavelengths. Mixing all gives white.
3. **Primary Colors**:
    - **Painting**: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow (CMY). The secondary colors are RGB.
    - **Light**: Red, Green, Blue (RGB). The secondary colors are CMY.

In essence, painting colors work by reflecting light, and the more you mix, the darker they get. Light colors work by emitting light, and the more you mix, the brighter they get.
