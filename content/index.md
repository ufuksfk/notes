Welcome to my first and only brain as I am unable to use the original one.
Let me show you how I organize things here.

First of all, I am a true podcast addict. I keep my podcast higlights at Highlights/Matter folder. I am using [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) as podcast listening app which makes me to highlight everything important.

And there are other highlights there as well. From Youtube, Hypothesis. I am organizing Wikipedia highlights seperately. I am also using Readwise but my highligts are still waiting for some workaround there.

After gathering all those bit size informations, next mission is to organize them. Those organization is very personal and here is my personal taste:
### People
In this folder, you can find people :) I think most important thing is from which mouth I heart or read that information. It is more important than a book or podcast for me. But for today I am failing to connect all the higlights to people. People folder is more like a list of people I learned something about them.
### Wiki
This is my personal wikipedia fork. For example, If I am learning something about Zen Buddhism, I tends to connect those notes to that main topic. And to organize topics, I couldn't find a better common ground database than Wikipedia.
### Products
As I am an engineer, I generally tends to list products or gather detailed information about them. So they can easily be part of Wiki folder, but for me they are as important as being a different object type.
### Calendar
I am also obsessed with being able to see everything in timeline. I am trying to connect my highlights to days. And I am also trying to catch all the relevant information I learned grouped by centuries, decades, years and so on. For example, for any spesific year you can at least find If I read a book from that year or watch a movie.
### Artifacts
I can find a better name but that folder means creations made by humans. Like books, art pieces, movies, Podcast shows.
For books, I am using goodreads Booksidian. I am not sure If I wrote my highlights from book there or seperately under Highlights/Books folder. But for now, they are there. And they are mostly missing.

So, I am going to transfer everything from Notion to here. It is going to take some time, but gonna worth it.
