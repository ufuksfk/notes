We need a good amount of train data!

* Data collection. 
	If we have scanner machine, it would result consistent output.
* Detect our handwriting with OCR
	We need that to catch all letters and correlate them with images.
* Detect styles for each letter
	Stroke paths, Glyph shapes, corners etc.
* Mimic handwriting
	SketchRNN (Google Magenta)
