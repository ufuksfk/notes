## 4. [To Inform and Delight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ1YHqgZzGQ&ab_channel=StefanyBustamante)

With a resumé including iconic concepts such as “I (Heart) New York” and Bob Dylan’s 1966 tour poster, [[Milton Glaser]] is a legend in the graphic design and advertising space. _To Inform and Delight_ offers a retrospective of the late artist’s significant impact on [graphic design in advertising](https://www.reviewstudio.com/blog/20-of-the-best-documentaries-on-the-art-of-graphic-design/).

The filmmaker explored Milton’s inner workings and how he produced the sheer volume of brilliant creative work that he did.

Milton shared his trick for interpreting abstract concepts in a way that will intuitively stick with consumers: “In terms of understanding communication, the creation of a puzzle is one of the tools that you have to make people understand things. When they are activating the problem-solving impulse of the brain – it’s stuck in people’s minds. They saw it once, and they remembered it.”
