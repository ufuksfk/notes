[[2025-01-03]] I took that [test](https://form.typeform.com/to/ejRtgCu9) and here is the result:
Your score 145/207
Based on the DSM-5, each question is scored individually (1-4 points).  

Your score places youÂ **above 70%**Â of the total points on this test. This suggestsÂ **some alignment with ADHD-related traits.**  
  
If you want access to medication or a formal diagnosis we strongly advise seeking advice from a healthcare professional.
